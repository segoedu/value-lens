Katsarov exempts hospitals from requirements for number of doctors###1###BG_140###[Achievement attained]###[Achievement]###[attained]
The lack of a parliament ties the hands of the caretaker government in many ways, but the caretaker health minister Stoycho Katsarov plans to use the situation to push through fundamental changes in the work of hospitals in the country.###2###BG_140###[Power: dominance attained]###[Power: dominance]###[attained]

The 26-page document has been published for public discussion and is likely to generate disputes whether it is right for a caretaker government to push through such reformist solutions in its limited mandate.###4###BG_140###[Power: dominance constrained]###[Power: dominance]###[constrained]
"""Many of these requirements were introduced over the years as a result of lobby pressure aimed at administratively restricting the supply of one or another type of medical activities, which led to limiting patients' choices of where to be treated and to hospitals' excessive costs for covering unjustified administrative requirements,"" the minister argued."###5###BG_140###[Power: dominance attained, Security: societal constrained]###[Power: dominance, Security: societal]###[attained, constrained]
There has been dissatisfaction with the standards in the system for years, but similar arguments can be made against the Minister's initiative with the opposite sign - the relaxation of requirements can be used in bad faith.###6###BG_140###[Conformity: rules constrained]###[Conformity: rules]###[constrained]
Imbalances in payment for clinical pathways, for example, led to a boom in invasive cardiology clinics years ago, without it being clear to what extent they all offer quality care.###7###BG_140###[Stimulation attained]###[Stimulation]###[attained]
Although adopted with good intentions - to improve the quality of medical care, there is no objective evidence of achieving this goal.###9###BG_140###[Security: societal constrained]###[Security: societal]###[constrained]
"Instead, the visible result of their implementation is the conclusion of fictitious employment contracts and the trading of diplomas,"" the minister further noted."###10###BG_140###[Conformity: rules constrained]###[Conformity: rules]###[constrained]
This is a fact - it is the standards and lack of doctors in certain specialties that have led to distortions where part-time retirees are brought in to work in two places, if only the hospital doesn't lose a clinical pathway.###11###BG_140###[Conformity: rules constrained]###[Conformity: rules]###[constrained]

"For example, in the standard for thoracic surgery, the requirement for a specific number of physicians - e.g., ""at least six physicians, at least three of whom must have a recognized specialty in thoracic surgery"" is replaced by ""at least six physicians, at least three of whom must have a recognized specialty in thoracic surgery"" is replaced by ""physician(s) with a specialty in thoracic surgery, and may also employ physician(s) with another specialty or no specialty, who provide meaningful care for the volume and complexity of work performed."""###16###BG_140###[Benevolence: caring attained]###[Benevolence: caring]###[attained]
"""By reducing unnecessary administrative requirements, medical institutions will gain more operational autonomy, the opportunity to reduce unnecessary costs and increase the salaries of working doctors and nurses,"" Katsarov points out."###19###BG_140###[Achievement attained]###[Achievement]###[attained]

Working more than 55 hours a week increases the risk of death due to cardiovascular problems, according to research by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO), a trend that appears to be increasing, with the agencies warning that it may worsen further due to the covid-19 pandemic.###2###EL_057###[Security: societal constrained]###[Security: societal]###[constrained]

"The ECB is considering the creation of ""bad banks"" if ""red"" loans increase too much"###1###EL_167###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
The European Central Bank (ECB) is considering the creation of bad banks if Europe's bad loans increase too much, says credit rating agency Moody's.###2###EL_167###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
In an analysis today, the house notes that the ECB's head of banking supervision, Andrea Henrias, said in a letter to a German MP that he personally supports the creation of a European portfolio management company, or bad bank, in the event of a significant deterioration of assets in the wider banking system due to the coronavirus.###3###EL_167###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
The option (of creating) a bad bank would be credit positive for European banks, because it would involve some degree of state support where needed, which would help banks to protect their solvency and possibly avoid failures, according to Moody's.###5###EL_167###[Power: resources attained, Benevolence: dependability attained]###[Power: resources, Benevolence: dependability]###[attained, attained]
The house acknowledges that obstacles to the creation of bad banks in Europe remain.###6###EL_167###[Power: resources constrained]###[Power: resources]###[constrained]
He believes, however, that Enrias' statement and the Financial Stability Report suggest that the ECB is preparing for a scenario in which the recent supervisory measures to protect bank capital (CET1) would not be sufficient and stronger measures, such as a bad bank recommendation, would be required.###8###EL_167###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
According to Moody's, the ECB's flexible strategy to help banks cope with the impact of the coronavirus spread is effective, provided that EU banks face only a short-lived economic contraction that does not turn into a full-blown crisis and a spike in non-performing loans (NPLs).###9###EL_167###[Achievement attained, Power: resources attained]###[Achievement, Power: resources]###[attained, attained]

How Greece can become an energy hub for Europe###1###EL_211###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
Greece can play a crucial role in Europe's energy security in the context of the redesign of the energy map after the gradual isolation of Russia.###2###EL_211###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
This can be achieved if it improves its energy efficiency, increases its energy production potential through investments in renewable energy sources and strengthens international electricity and gas interconnections.###3###EL_211###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
In this way, Greece can become a hub for the transfer of economic green energy to Europe and triple its electricity and gas exports over the next 10 years.###4###EL_211###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
At the same time, increasing the country's energy self-sufficiency by 2030 through the above-mentioned actions could bring significant GDP benefits of 2.5 to 3.5 billion per year.###5###EL_211###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
According to a study by the Economic Analysis Department of the National Bank of Greece, the country's energy dependence on energy imports is high as Greece produces only 25% of the energy it consumes (compared to 43% in the EU).###6###EL_211###[Power: resources constrained]###[Power: resources]###[constrained]
In fact, due to its high dependence on energy imports, Greece is experiencing high energy prices for as long as the crisis lasts.###8###EL_211###[Power: resources constrained]###[Power: resources]###[constrained]
At the same time, natural gas imports are important, covering 22% of energy needs, while the country's dependence on Russia is a source of uncertainty.###10###EL_211###[Power: resources constrained]###[Power: resources]###[constrained]
According to the ETE study, with Europe on alert in case of a disruption of flows from Russia, Greece has access to substitute sources.###11###EL_211###[Power: resources attained, Security: societal constrained]###[Power: resources, Security: societal]###[attained, constrained]
Also, the redesign of the energy map can be an opportunity for Greece in the long term, provided that the country improves its energy efficiency by 20% and increases energy production through investments of up to �25 billion for the effective penetration of RES in its energy mix.###12###EL_211###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
At the same time, with Greece's planned electrical interconnections with Balkan and Mediterranean countries worth around �7 billion, the country's ability to import and export electricity is estimated to triple over the next decade.###14###EL_211###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]

The Pope Says 'Humanity Must Repent For Abusing Mother Earth'###1###EN_015###[Universalism: nature constrained]###[Universalism: nature]###[constrained]
We humans �must repent and modify our lifestyles� because of our abuse of Mother Earth, Pope Francis states in a message released Thursday.###2###EN_015###[Universalism: nature constrained]###[Universalism: nature]###[constrained]
In his Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation, the pontiff decries the �mistreatment� of our common home stemming from �our consumerist excesses,� �tyrannical anthropocentrism,� �predatory economic interests,� and �short sighted and selfish actions� leading to �the collapse of our planet�s ecosystems.�###3###EN_015###[Universalism: nature constrained]###[Universalism: nature]###[constrained]

�Listening to these anguished cries, we must repent and modify our lifestyles and destructive systems,� Francis proposes, since the �present state of decay of our common home merits the same attention as other global challenges such as grave health crises and wars.�###8###EN_015###[Universalism: nature attained]###[Universalism: nature]###[attained]
The ecological conversion needed to bring about lasting change cannot simply take place at the individual level, the pope insists, but must be �also a community conversion� embracing multilateral solutions, �especially in the meetings of the United Nations devoted to the environmental question.�###9###EN_015###[Universalism: nature attained]###[Universalism: nature]###[attained]
In his Message, Francis also plugs the COP27 conference on climate change, to be held in Egypt in November 2022, which �represents the next opportunity for all to join in promoting the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement.�###10###EN_015###[Universalism: nature attained]###[Universalism: nature]###[attained]
The Holy See subscribes to the Paris goal of limiting temperature increase to 1.5�C, Francis states, which �calls for responsible cooperation between all nations in presenting climate plans or more ambitious nationally determined contributions in order to reduce to zero, as quickly as possible, net greenhouse gas emissions.�###11###EN_015###[Conformity: rules attained, Universalism: nature attained]###[Conformity: rules, Universalism: nature]###[attained, attained]

This debt also means �keeping their promises of financial and technical support for the economically poorer nations, which are already experiencing most of the burden of the climate crisis,� he proposes.###18###EN_015###[Universalism: concern attained]###[Universalism: concern]###[attained]

According to the agreements being formed between the Ministries of Finance and Health, it appears that all street shops and open shopping centers will be opened, including clothing and footwear stores.###3###HE_049###[Conformity: rules attained]###[Conformity: rules]###[attained]

During the discussions that took place today ahead of the government meeting, several disagreements arose between the ministries: in the Ministry of Health they agreed on the return of the book work, but opposed the return of the beauticians.###6###HE_049###[Conformity: rules attained]###[Conformity: rules]###[attained]
Also, during the discussions, representatives of the Ministry of Finance insisted on opening fashion and footwear stores, and the Ministry of Health initially opposed this.###7###HE_049###[Conformity: rules attained]###[Conformity: rules]###[attained]

Earlier, the Ministry of Economy also formulated a series of recommendations for the meeting, which will take place in light of the pressure exerted by the ministers in the cabinet discussion yesterday, but due to its preoccupation with the restrictions that will be imposed on the days of remembrance, independence and the Ramadan holiday - the handling of the arguments was postponed for today.###12###HE_049###[Conformity: rules attained]###[Conformity: rules]###[attained]
In this context, Economy Minister Eli Cohen (Likud) is expected to present the demands as raised on behalf of his office, according to which more businesses should be allowed to return to regular work alongside dealing with the spread of the corona virus.###13###HE_049###[Security: societal attained]###[Security: societal]###[attained]
"According to the ministry, although the facilities are not defined as prohibited in the current regulations, the interpretation of the Ministry of Health holds that they are included under the definition of &quot;mall&quot;, which creates a lot of confusion and an overly broad interpretation."###15###HE_049###[Conformity: rules attained, Conformity: rules constrained]###[Conformity: rules, Conformity: rules]###[attained, constrained]
"&quot;Since the opening of shops on the street is allowed, it does not seem reasonable to prevent the opening of shops in shopping complexes&quot;, said the Ministry of Economy, emphasizing: &quot;A shopping complex is not a closed complex, it is spread out much more than the street, therefore the amendment is requested.&quot;"###16###HE_049###[Conformity: rules attained, Conformity: rules constrained]###[Conformity: rules, Conformity: rules]###[attained, constrained]

"The rest of the recommendations of the Ministry of Economy concern other industries, which according to the Ministry&#39;s officials, &quot;the reason for their omission&quot; from the list of permitted businesses is not clear, including car washes, money changers, lottery booths, agencies and lots for the sale of vehicles and nurseries."###18###HE_049###[Conformity: rules attained, Conformity: rules constrained]###[Conformity: rules, Conformity: rules]###[attained, constrained]
The office claimed that the reason for their closure is not clear, since most of them have buffering conditions between the customers and the sellers, or alternatively they have open spaces similar to other businesses that are currently open anyway, such as garages and gas stations.###19###HE_049###[Security: societal attained]###[Security: societal]###[attained]
The office also recommended that the stores for baby products be opened, since this is an essential area for citizens and that there are baby furniture stores that are allowed to open anyway and also sell toys and baby equipment, and a feeling of discrimination is created.###20###HE_049###[Universalism: concern attained]###[Universalism: concern]###[attained]

"These industries have been causing controversy for a long time in the discussions on the exit strategy, and in the discussion that took place yesterday, Finance Minister Kahlon and Minister Cohen called for their regulation, fearing the development of a &quot;black market&quot; in customers&#39; homes, without any compliance with the health regulations required in the fight against Corona."###23###HE_049###[Security: societal attained, Security: societal constrained]###[Security: societal, Security: societal]###[attained, constrained]

"Apart from these, the Ministry of Economy is calling for the amendment of regulations for service providers in the customer&#39;s home and in the public space, including for example driving instructors, private tutors, babysitters, repairmen, gardeners, medical therapists, sales agents, dog walkers, and more."###27###HE_049###[Conformity: rules attained]###[Conformity: rules]###[attained]
According to the ministry, there are currently no clear instructions for these service providers, and that they should be allowed to return to work.###28###HE_049###[Conformity: rules attained, Conformity: rules constrained]###[Conformity: rules, Conformity: rules]###[attained, constrained]

Weapons instead of drugs: drug smuggling is expanding, criminals are motivated by money but also by nationalism###1###HE_125###[Security: societal constrained]###[Security: societal]###[constrained]
The wave of illegal drug smuggling into Israel from Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt does not stop and only gets worse, in the absence of a hermetic border, and in view of the vacuum created by the lack of military personnel along the borders, the police recognize the strategic threat and invest effort to thwart the smuggling with the help of the IDF.###2###HE_125###[Security: societal attained, Security: societal constrained]###[Security: societal, Security: societal]###[attained, constrained]
Although they manage to register significant achievements, this does not deter the Israeli and foreign smugglers from continuing their criminal activities and smuggling drugs and deadly weapons to perpetrators of crime and terrorist elements in Israel, among other things, due to the large financial profit they scoop into their pockets.###3###HE_125###[Achievement attained, Power: resources attained]###[Achievement, Power: resources]###[attained, attained]
The assessment among security officials is that today in Israel there are tens of thousands of illegal weapons that are strengthened by perpetrators of crime, in Arab society in particular, that have been stockpiled over the years for the purpose of deterrence until actual use that ends in injury and death.###4###HE_125###[Security: societal constrained]###[Security: societal]###[constrained]
The characteristics of the smuggling that has been thwarted in the last three years are usually a larger amount of weapons and ammunition and less drugs such as cocaine and marijuana, and this is due to the huge profit inherent in selling them in Israel.###5###HE_125###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
For example, the 4th and 5th generation Glock pistols, among the most advanced on the market, whose cost is estimated at $2,000, are priced in the Israeli market at about NIS 45,000.###6###HE_125###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
An M-16, whose cost is estimated at several thousand dollars, is sold on the Israeli market for 90-110 thousand shekels, and a Kalashnikov rifle for 60 thousand shekels.###7###HE_125###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
On the other hand, the demand for the Carlo rifle is decreasing due to the operational need of criminals for a reliable and accurate weapon.###8###HE_125###[Achievement constrained]###[Achievement]###[constrained]
For example, until Operation Northern Shield in 2018, in which terrorist tunnels of the terrorist organization Hezbollah into Israel were thwarted, the organization tried to maintain calm in the sector and no large-scale smuggling of ammunition was carried out.###10###HE_125###[Security: societal attained]###[Security: societal]###[attained]
However, after the operation, there was a dramatic increase in the number of illegal arms smuggling under the auspices of Hezbollah, both in the quantities and the high quality of the weapons.###11###HE_125###[Security: societal constrained]###[Security: societal]###[constrained]
At the same time, the perforated Israel-Jordan border line is more preferred for illegal drug smugglers.###12###HE_125###[Security: societal constrained]###[Security: societal]###[constrained]
In the past, most of the weapons were diverted to the territories, and accordingly, those who led the smuggling operations from the Israeli side were Palestinians living in the territories, who sold a certain part of the weapons to perpetrators of crime in the Arab society in Israel.###13###HE_125###[Security: societal constrained]###[Security: societal]###[constrained]
But today most of the weapons and ammunition go directly to Israeli Arab criminals, and thus the relationship between the parties has tightened to a level where Israeli Arabs, from the Triangle in the north to the Bedouin diaspora in the south, defeat the smuggling operations and manage the ammunition trade without any fear.###14###HE_125###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
The types of goods smuggled at the borders in the district sector change dramatically all the time, from drugs to weapons, and thus, in recent years, the smugglers at the Lebanese border changed phase, and began to prioritize the smuggling of illegal drugs over cocaine and drugs of various types, not only for economic reasons but also for nationalistic reasons.###15###HE_125###[Security: societal constrained]###[Security: societal]###[constrained]
"This is the case, for example, in the case of smuggling amlach that was caught while guarding the Walls, including 180 grenades, intended for the &quot;Brothers in the Galilee&quot;, that is, for Israeli Arab citizens in the north against police and security forces during the riots at the Walls."###16###HE_125###[Security: societal constrained]###[Security: societal]###[constrained]
Another case, the attack in which Eliyahu Kay was murdered by the terrorist Fadi Abu Shahid in Jerusalem, was carried out using standard weapons that were estimated to have been smuggled from Jordan.###17###HE_125###[Security: personal constrained]###[Security: personal]###[constrained]
"The attack that happened at the beginning of the week in the Bekaa against the soldiers&#39; bus was also carried out according to estimates using weapons smuggled from the Jordanian border."###18###HE_125###[Security: societal constrained]###[Security: societal]###[constrained]
On the Syrian border, on the other hand, the weapons smuggling mainly contains Soviet weapons such as Kalashnikovs, while the weapons smuggling on the Jordanian border originating from Iraq mostly contains Western or American weapons.###19###HE_125###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
Since the arrival of the Negev Region Sub-Commissioner Nachshon Nagler, and under the command of Commander Peretz Amr to his position, emphasis has been given to offensive activity against the perpetrators of crime and arms smuggling, this in the face of the increase in the scope of the phenomenon.###21###HE_125###[Security: societal attained, Security: societal constrained]###[Security: societal, Security: societal]###[attained, constrained]
Since the beginning of 2022, about 12 illegal drug smuggling have been thwarted in the South District, a significant increase from previous years, with five smuggling being thwarted in 2021 and three in 2020.###22###HE_125###[Security: societal attained]###[Security: societal]###[attained]
On the Israel-Egypt border, on the other hand, drugs are mainly smuggled, from cannabis of all kinds to cocaine and heroin, which make their way from Ethiopia through Cairo to the Israel-Egypt border, straight to the Israeli drug dealers who are not content with smuggling through flights and mail.###23###HE_125###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
Some of the drug smuggling moves in the opposite way, from Israel to Egypt.###24###HE_125###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]

Precedent PSAD: A controlling owner can purchase the shares of the public company under his control at the market price only###1###HE_160###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
When a controlling owner purchases the shares of the public company under his control, two major problems arise: the conflict of interest and the price.###2###HE_160###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
This week, the judge of the Central District Court, Benny Arnon, dismissed a derivative suit against the controlling owner and officers of the Optibase real estate company.###3###HE_160###[Conformity: rules attained]###[Conformity: rules]###[attained]
Arnon, in a comprehensive 130-page ruling, ruled in favor of the company regarding three private allocations it made to its controlling owner, Shlomo Weiler, in 2008, 2011 and 2013.###4###HE_160###[Conformity: rules attained]###[Conformity: rules]###[attained]
According to the plaintiffs, the shareholders Simcha and Baruria Shiloni, the allocations were made with a conflict of interest of the controlling owner who was on both sides of the transaction, and at prices lower than the fair and proper value of the stock on each of these dates.###5###HE_160###[Power: resources attained, Power: resources constrained]###[Power: resources, Power: resources]###[attained, constrained]
The price question is the central message in the story.###6###HE_160###[Power: resources attained, Power: resources constrained]###[Power: resources, Power: resources]###[attained, constrained]
In situations where the controlling owner wishes to purchase its shares in order to disappear from the stock market and turn a public company into a private one, strict conditions have been imposed on the board, due to the fear of improper manipulation.###7###HE_160###[Conformity: rules attained]###[Conformity: rules]###[attained]
For example, if the controlling owner knows about an imminent exit and therefore has an interest in keeping the public away from the expected profits.###8###HE_160###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
"Therefore, in the case of &#39;going private&#39; (turning a company from public to private), the controlling owner is obliged to make a &quot;full tender offer&quot; and the price will be determined according to the DCF method - future cash flow - which embodies the future valuation of the company."###9###HE_160###[Power: resources attained, Power: resources constrained]###[Power: resources, Power: resources]###[attained, constrained]
Arnon stated in the current case that in the absence of suspicion of manipulation, the price will be the market value of the share only.###10###HE_160###[Face attained]###[Face]###[attained]
"This, after he was convinced of the legitimacy of the reasons for the allocation - the company&#39;s need for cash, by way of selling shares to the controlling owner who pours money into it in exchange for shares."###11###HE_160###[Power: resources attained, Face attained]###[Power: resources, Face]###[attained, attained]
"&quot;Different from a full tender offer,&quot; Arnon wrote, &quot;a private share allocation makes it possible to examine the stock&#39;s behavior in the market after the shares are allocated, and accordingly to identify whether the allocation was made at a price that does not reflect the fair value of the share, including due to the use of insider information or due to the choice of timing manipulative to make the allocation by the controlling owner&quot;."###12###HE_160###[Power: resources attained, Power: resources constrained]###[Power: resources, Power: resources]###[attained, constrained]
That is, if the controlling owner Weiler will later profit from the shares he purchased in the allotment, the rest of the stockholders will also profit as well.###13###HE_160###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
"So it&#39;s debatable whether Weiler acted to save the company or took advantage of a business opportunity."###14###HE_160###[Power: resources attained, Power: resources constrained]###[Power: resources, Power: resources]###[attained, constrained]
But, even if he survives, all shareholders will benefit - unlike in the case where the company was delisted.###15###HE_160###[Power: resources attained, Power: resources constrained]###[Power: resources, Power: resources]###[attained, constrained]
The plaintiffs claimed that the company did not examine alternative ways of raising funds, such as loans for example or issuing shares to the public.###16###HE_160###[Power: resources constrained]###[Power: resources]###[constrained]
"In this matter, the judge ruled in favor of the company, when he applied the &#39;business judgment&#39; rule."###17###HE_160###[Conformity: rules attained]###[Conformity: rules]###[attained]
In dealing with the claim of conflict of interest raised by the plaintiffs, Arnon stated that the decision passed the triple approval required for transactions involving interested parties - the approval of the audit committee, the board of directors and the general meeting, with a large majority of untainted shareholders.###18###HE_160###[Conformity: rules attained]###[Conformity: rules]###[attained]
So the judge applied the essentially procedural rule, which immunizes the officers from lawsuits if they acted in good faith, in the absence of a conflict of interest and in an informed manner, that is, they reviewed and considered the deal.###19###HE_160###[Conformity: rules attained]###[Conformity: rules]###[attained]
The plaintiffs argued that the stricter test should be applied because it is a transaction in which the controlling owner stands on both sides.###20###HE_160###[Conformity: rules attained]###[Conformity: rules]###[attained]
"This is the &quot;rule of complete fairness&quot; test, which was applied by Judge Dania Keret Meir in the Makhteshim Agan deal."###21###HE_160###[Conformity: rules attained]###[Conformity: rules]###[attained]
"A rule that checks the fairness of the transaction itself, and not just its procedural cleanliness, as required by the &quot;business judgment rule&quot; test."###22###HE_160###[Conformity: rules attained]###[Conformity: rules]###[attained]
Arnon rejected the demand to apply the strict rule.###23###HE_160###[Conformity: rules attained]###[Conformity: rules]###[attained]
"In his opinion, it should be applied &quot;only when the transaction shows suspicious signs such as a noticeable inequality between the controlling owner and the other shareholders&quot;."###24###HE_160###[Power: resources attained, Power: resources constrained]###[Power: resources, Power: resources]###[attained, constrained]
"Arnon stated that &quot;the decision to raise capital for the company was a reasonable and logical decision under the circumstances.&quot;"###25###HE_160###[Self-direction: action attained]###[Self-direction: action]###[attained]
"The bottom line, summarizes attorney Sharon Lubetzky Hess of Amit Polk Matlon, who represented some of the officers, is that &quot;in the absence of fear of manipulation of the share price, a public company can make a private allocation to its controlling owner at the market price, without being required to carry out a valuation of its shares ."###26###HE_160###[Power: resources attained]###[Power: resources]###[attained]
"In this way, the verdict contributes to creating certainty, which did not exist until now, regarding the proper pricing of the company&#39;s shares for the purpose of carrying out a private allocation, which as a rule is a faster and cheaper option for raising capital for the company, certainly in relation to the issue of shares to the public, which requires the publication of a prospectus and additional costs on the side."###27###HE_160###[Power: resources attained, Security: societal attained]###[Power: resources, Security: societal]###[attained, attained]

The European Charcot Foundation together with the MS International Federation (MSIF) and the Italian Multiple Sclerosis Association, AISM, presented a new global initiative at the European congress dedicated to multiple sclerosis (Ectrims) to increasingly value people's perspective in multiple sclerosis (MS) research and health care.###2###IT_031###[Benevolence: dependability attained]###[Benevolence: dependability]###[attained]
The project is called PROMS-an acronym for 'Patient Reported Outcomes for MS'-and AISM will have the role of 'Lead Agency,' tasked with promoting and coordinating this global initiative on behalf of MSIF.The global initiative will bring together the international MS community, people with multiple sclerosis, health care professionals and researchers, industry, and many other stakeholders, with the goal of promoting science that increasingly gives substance to the patient perspective, bringing the experiences of people with MS into scientific research, trials for the development of new therapies, and health systems development.###3###IT_031###[Benevolence: dependability attained]###[Benevolence: dependability]###[attained]

Trani, Pyramid dispute: start of the tug-of-war, concern for employees###1###IT_091###[Security: societal constrained]###[Security: societal]###[constrained]
The labor and union tug-of-war has officially begun, with all the inconveniences already brought about by the eight-hour lockout implemented, since dawn yesterday, by all the workers at the Italian Commercial Pyramid Spa, the Megamark Group's logistics platform, which the large Tranese distribution company intends to outsource.###2###IT_091###[Security: societal constrained]###[Security: societal]###[constrained]

While the truce invoked by the world in Berlin is yet another piece of paper in the Libyan crisis shredded by guns, an accurate first calculation of the damage General Khalifa Haftar is managing to produce by blocking oil terminals and fields has arrived: nearly $260 million in six days.###4###IT_132###[Power: resources constrained, Conformity: rules constrained]###[Power: resources, Conformity: rules]###[constrained, constrained]
The figure (256.6 million) was provided by Libya's national oil company, Noc, which put current production at just over 320,000 barrels per day, down three-quarters from more than 1.2 million last week.###5###IT_132###[Power: resources constrained]###[Power: resources]###[constrained]
Noc's prediction remains that Libyan crude oil extraction could collapse further in a few days to 72 barrels , a level similar to that at the time of Muammar Gaddafi's fall in 2011.###6###IT_132###[Power: resources constrained]###[Power: resources]###[constrained]
Haftar a week ago, just the day before the Libya conference in the German capital, had crude oil cargo blocked from five ports under his control in the Sirte oil crescent causing an export cut of 800,000 barrels a day.###7###IT_132###[Power: resources constrained]###[Power: resources]###[constrained]
Through closing valves in two pipelines, the general also had the Sharara , Libya's largest, and Hamada oil fields shut down and reduce production in the El Feel field, also operated by Eni, potentially cutting an additional approximately 400,000 barrels per day overall.###8###IT_132###[Power: resources constrained]###[Power: resources]###[constrained]
In addition to wanting to throw his weight around in Berlin, according to analysts such as Tim Eaton of the U.S. think-tank Chatham House, the general thus concretizes his accusation that Noc is siding with Tripoli and the government of PM Fayez al-Sarraj even though the international community agrees that the oil company is and should remain an impartial institution between the two sides.###9###IT_132###[Power: dominance attained, Power: dominance constrained]###[Power: dominance, Power: dominance]###[attained, constrained]
Fronts fighting each other, as evidenced by the destruction of some of Haftar's military assets announced by pro-government forces in the area of Wadi al-Rabie, about 25 km as the crow flies southeast of Martyrs' Square, the center of Tripoli , by the sea: although no casualties are reported beyond the more than 2,000 commonly estimated dead among militiamen (not counting the nearly 300 civilians killed), the destruction of assets is a sign that the fighting is violent.###10###IT_132###[Power: dominance attained, Power: dominance constrained, Security: societal constrained]###[Power: dominance, Power: dominance, Security: societal]###[attained, constrained, constrained]

Autostrade's scathing letter, in retort to the rules inserted by the government in a decree to stipulate that if, as a result of its serious default, a concessionaire is declared forfeited, the damages caused by its negligence will be deducted from the (copious) compensation it would be entitled to, is proof that Aspi has not only maintenance problems but also communication problems, not only technical problems but also cultural problems.###2###IT_163###[Face constrained, Conformity: rules constrained]###[Face, Conformity: rules]###[constrained, constrained]
But other reflections arise from this ugly letter.###3###IT_163###[Face constrained]###[Face]###[constrained]
In the meantime, a question: how has privatization been done in Italy, if provision has been made that, in case of proven fault of the concessionaire, the concessionaire will lapse from the concession with the right to the same compensation that he would be entitled to if the concession were taken away from him without any just cause?###4###IT_163###[Conformity: rules constrained]###[Conformity: rules]###[constrained]
And then a thought: the idea of everything reverting to Anas is national suicide, because the company, proverbial for its laziness and bureaucratic slowness (to say the least), would either risklessly close everything or almost everything (with the golden principle of public administration: I don't want any trouble) or definitely do nothing: the state of the state highways is there to be a text for those who dream of a return to the republic of cantonment.###5###IT_163###[Stimulation constrained, Face constrained]###[Stimulation, Face]###[constrained, constrained]
But that it has not been possible, after the tragic Morandi experience, to find a dialogue between the state and concessionaires to review the most unbalanced aspects of concessions is truly puzzling.###6###IT_163###[Stimulation constrained]###[Stimulation]###[constrained]
On the one hand money, on the other propaganda: two needs that are not conducive to agreements.###7###IT_163###[Stimulation constrained]###[Stimulation]###[constrained]
But while it is understandable that Aspi could not confront Toninelli's linguistic maximalism, the fact that he cannot even relate to Minister De Micheli's civilized and moderate language is truly unbelievable and is all to his detriment.###8###IT_163###[Face constrained]###[Face]###[constrained]
The Morandi Bridge fell one year and four months ago, and a court judgment on the causes and responsibilities of its collapse is still far from even in sight.###10###IT_163###[Conformity: rules constrained]###[Conformity: rules]###[constrained]
But since then Aspi (especially her) has been in the dock and has seen accusations, shreds of evidence, excerpts of interrogations, excerpts of documents, interviews raining down on her every day, to which, partly because of her inability to communicate publicly blatantly reiterated by the letter to the government, she knows how to respond only with the unpopular delaying maneuvers of her lawyers, good for stalling but certainly not for dispelling suspicions.###12###IT_163###[Face constrained, Conformity: rules constrained]###[Face, Conformity: rules]###[constrained, constrained]
Perhaps in a country of less entangled and chatty law, it would have already been ruled that, if it did not fall because of a traumatic event, the bridge collapsed because of its precarious condition, and the maintainer would then have been convicted, whether or not he was awarded mitigation on the basis of actual cognizability of actual attrition.###13###IT_163###[Stimulation constrained, Face constrained]###[Stimulation, Face]###[constrained, constrained]

So goes our justice.###15###IT_163###[Hedonism constrained]###[Hedonism]###[constrained]
Unfortunately, pending the only authorized judgment, that of a court of law, which, if of guilt, would really nail Aspi to a conviction for gross misconduct and then to procedures to revoke the concession, the months of investigation have so far resolved mostly into a trickle of rumors, statements, half-news, alarms, in a noisy judicial-media circuit.###16###IT_163###[Conformity: rules constrained]###[Conformity: rules]###[constrained]
In all likelihood, Aspi's fault is really there.###17###IT_163###[Stimulation constrained]###[Stimulation]###[constrained]
What can a foreigner think of a trial held in the investigation and in the newspapers too much before the real one (assuming it is ever held)?###20###IT_163###[Stimulation constrained]###[Stimulation]###[constrained]

The job of the Chairman of the RIA Board is to repair and build safe roads and to introduce the toll system, not to get into political games.###2###BG_034###[]###[]###[]
This was said by the Deputy Chairman of the Bulgarian BSP for Bulgaria Georgi Svilensky during a press conference at the party headquarters, reported a reporter of Focus News Agency.###3###BG_034###[]###[]###[]
"He gave the chronology of the BSP initiative. ""On November 2, 2018, more than half of the parliamentary group of BSP for Bulgaria, not to say the whole group, signed a request for permission for an independent expert examination by an independent European laboratory from the RIA."###6###BG_034###[]###[]###[]
"This is how it should be"", Svilensky said."###7###BG_034###[]###[]###[]
He added that the reply was given by the RIA on December 4, saying to name the party's road experts and give the name of the laboratories , to get in touch with them to decide what to do.###8###BG_034###[]###[]###[]
"""Elena Yoncheva said a moment ago."###9###BG_034###[]###[]###[]
"We ask for the permit, then we immediately submit it to the independent European laboratory, it carries out the analyses, compares them with the designs as they were and comes before you and says: ""Dear Bulgarian citizens, the roads were designed this way, they were built this way, they are currently in this condition - you decide whether there is a violation""."###11###BG_034###[]###[]###[]
Moving on, March 15 we are sending a letter specifying the sections because the previous letter said to specify them.###12###BG_034###[]###[]###[]
We say, well, let them know where they went wrong.###13###BG_034###[]###[]###[]
We give them 46 points of Bulgarian highways that we think have a problem.###14###BG_034###[]###[]###[]
"This happens on March 15, on May 2 we receive a letter from the chairman of the RIA Board, in which he says: ""Given the large number of sections for which the documentation is requested, and given the fact that some of the sections listed - Hemus, Trakia - were built in the 1980s, but were repaired until 5 years ago, additional time is needed to prepare and organize the requested documentation for all the sections listed."###15###BG_034###[]###[]###[]
"In view of the above, additional time is required for the information provided to you."""###16###BG_034###[]###[]###[]
We literally take it as a normal response.###17###BG_034###[]###[]###[]
"They need more time - they are not yet clear what to do"", Svilensky added."###18###BG_034###[]###[]###[]
However, he said, the MPs can consult it in the archives of the RIA.###20###BG_034###[]###[]###[]
"""We want permission to carry out an expert examination and once it is done, then we want the documentation, but not in the archives of the RIA, but handed over in due order as MPs,"" Svilensky said."###21###BG_034###[]###[]###[]

Mikhail Konstantinov during a meeting convened by President Rumen Radev with representatives of the CEC, responsible institutions and analysts of the electoral process in connection with the conduct and organization of local elections this year, a reporter of the Focus news agency reported.###5###BG_041###[]###[]###[]
Prof. Konstantinov pointed out that there was practically no difference in the invalid votes in the 2015 elections compared to this year's.###8###BG_041###[]###[]###[]
And for councillors only 6%.###10###BG_041###[]###[]###[]
Konstantinov summarized the data, pointing out that the least number of invalid ballots was in Sofia - 5%, and the most in Vidin - 23%.###13###BG_041###[]###[]###[]
"""In Varna - 11%."###14###BG_041###[]###[]###[]
In Kardzhali - 14%, below the national average.###15###BG_041###[]###[]###[]
"In Montana - 21%,"" he added."###16###BG_041###[]###[]###[]
President Radev replied that he rather sees the machine voting as working with an ATM that everyone knows well and that the use of the internet has nothing to do with the process.###20###BG_041###[]###[]###[]
This impresses everyone.###25###BG_041###[]###[]###[]
Rumen Radev pointed to corporate and bought votes as another problem facing the electoral process.###28###BG_041###[]###[]###[]
If we look at the statistics and reports from the SANS, the Ministry of Interior and the prosecutor's office, there are no significant differences between the local elections of 2015 and 2019, but looking at all that the experts summarise, the feeling in the people is that there is an industry going on here for tens of millions.###30###BG_041###[]###[]###[]
It is shameful that this is happening in a European country in the 21st century.###31###BG_041###[]###[]###[]
SCC:###1###BG_042###[]###[]###[]
This was made clear by a ruling of the SCC.###4###BG_042###[]###[]###[]
It is final.###5###BG_042###[]###[]###[]
The case was initiated on cassation appeals by the defendant Tenyo Enchev and his counsel against the decision of the Court of Appeal - Burgas, which upheld the verdict of the District Court - Burgas.###7###BG_042###[]###[]###[]
For this he was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment.###9###BG_042###[]###[]###[]
The three-member chamber of the SCC emphasizes in its reasoning that at a hearing on 30.01.2019 the defendant Enchev and his counsel have requested the Burgas District Court to hear the case under the procedure of summary investigation.###12###BG_042###[]###[]###[]
There is no evidence that this was not done voluntarily without his understanding the nature of the procedure and its consequences.###14###BG_042###[]###[]###[]
They emphasise that the focus of the ruling is on the content of the indictment and the facts and circumstances reflected therein, reflecting on the application of the substantive law, as well as the decision taken in this respect by the deciding courts.###17###BG_042###[]###[]###[]
According to the defence, there is no evidence for the accepted presence of the qualifying circumstance under Art. 1(6)(2) and (3) of the Criminal Code, therefore the material law was violated by sentencing the defendant under this text.###18###BG_042###[]###[]###[]
The foregoing is entirely true with respect to the claim of lack of intent in causing death.###22###BG_042###[]###[]###[]
Such a fact is suggested by the defendant himself.###25###BG_042###[]###[]###[]
"The reasoning of the SCC says: ""However, there is a lack of such among the facts on the charging instrument."###26###BG_042###[]###[]###[]
And this is exactly what the perpetrator has admitted under Article 371(2) et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure.###28###BG_042###[]###[]###[]
"Not to mention that because of the particular manifestation of Enchev's actions, the claim could hardly be reasoned on the plane of lack of intent, even if the fact treated were accepted."""###29###BG_042###[]###[]###[]

After the elections, when the National Assembly is formed, the draft budget will be tabled.###8###BG_055###[]###[]###[]
Finding the focus and policies on where and how our money should be spent is the job of the newly formed National Assembly team.###9###BG_055###[]###[]###[]

"""We will propose in the draft budget a real budget for the RIA."###13###BG_055###[]###[]###[]
"Rough calculations show that the necessary funds for road maintenance are in the range of 1.5 - 2 billion per year,"" said Yanev."###15###BG_055###[]###[]###[]
In his words, the newly assumed debt by the state is not invented by the caretaker cabinet, but is provided for as part of the state budget law.###16###BG_055###[]###[]###[]

We need at least 12 doctors and 24 nurses.###30###BG_080###[]###[]###[]
He said he would like to open a children's coronavirus sector as well, but again he needs medics.###32###BG_080###[]###[]###[]
Because of all this, the amount allocated by the council is likely to go towards salaries.###33###BG_080###[]###[]###[]
The hope is that the government will also give money.###34###BG_080###[]###[]###[]
INTERVENTIONS.###35###BG_080###[]###[]###[]
But on this topic there were sparks between him and his predecessor Ivan Totev, who is a regional leader of GERB.###37###BG_080###[]###[]###[]
"""The hospital was not closed, but relocated."###39###BG_080###[]###[]###[]
You can tell everything when you are in such a state.###42###BG_080###[]###[]###[]
"He wants to help."""###43###BG_080###[]###[]###[]
Totev's words are yet another proof of the tension in GERB - Plovdiv, which is intensifying as the parliamentary elections approach.###44###BG_080###[]###[]###[]
The issues around healthcare are just a current occasion for them to erupt.###45###BG_080###[]###[]###[]
Prof.###1###BG_090###[]###[]###[]
"This was stated by the MP from ""BSP for Bulgaria"" prof."###4###BG_090###[]###[]###[]
Rumen Gechev told Nova TV.###5###BG_090###[]###[]###[]
Trimorie is a problem.###6###BG_090###[]###[]###[]
It is frivolous, when you have representatives in the committee, to claim that something is wrong.###11###BG_090###[]###[]###[]
An example of interference are the words of Vice President Iliana Iotova.###12###BG_090###[]###[]###[]
She said in the first days of the new government that it would not get even 100 days, although this is an international practice.###13###BG_090###[]###[]###[]
And I do not like Yotova to say that the social policy of the government is a failure.###16###BG_090###[]###[]###[]
Some people are not reconciled with the principled position of the BSP, who want to maintain a good balance.###20###BG_090###[]###[]###[]
I think common sense prevails.###22###BG_090###[]###[]###[]
Once the decision on pensions has been made, the funds will reach the elderly, even if this is a build-up in August.###24###BG_090###[]###[]###[]
When they took power in 2009, we had a debt of 13.5%, so under them our debt was doubled.###27###BG_090###[]###[]###[]
What we would insist on in negotiations is to be careful with foreign policy assessments.###29###BG_090###[]###[]###[]
The BSP has a decision of its National Council and we insist on negotiations with Gazprom.###32###BG_090###[]###[]###[]

The Head of State is visiting the Federal Republic of Germany at the invitation of his counterpart President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, with whom the Bulgarian President held a meeting in Berlin.###6###BG_092###[]###[]###[]
We can overcome today's challenges successfully only if together we develop technologies, seek new solutions and create production, the Head of State emphasized.###7###BG_092###[]###[]###[]
During his visit to Hamburg, President Rumen Radev also held a meeting with the leadership and representatives of the Chamber of Commerce.###11###BG_092###[]###[]###[]
During the meeting at the Chamber of Commerce the representatives of the Bulgarian business, included in the delegation led by the Head of State, had the opportunity to discuss with their German counterparts opportunities for cooperation.###14###BG_092###[]###[]###[]

He gave the example not only of Ukraine, but also of the Western Balkan countries.###15###BG_093###[]###[]###[]

"""If anyone should be placed under ban, it is the representatives of Revival"", reacted unusually sharply Hristo Ivanov to the declaration."###10###BG_098###[]###[]###[]
Interim Parliament Speaker Miroslav Ivanov made a remark to all those who spoke.###12###BG_098###[]###[]###[]
ITN did not support the outgoing Prime Minister Kiril Petkov for Bulgaria's decision to recall 70 Russian diplomats.###14###BG_098###[]###[]###[]
"According to him, the action of recalling diplomats was like a ""dance"" because the other side was taking reciprocal measures."###19###BG_098###[]###[]###[]
Maya Manolova, the leader of Stand Up Bulgaria, also expressed criticism regarding the recall of Russian diplomats.###24###BG_098###[]###[]###[]
"""In its attempt to win the favour of the Western partners, the government of Petkov and Ninova crossed all borders, taking more extreme positions than most European countries."###25###BG_098###[]###[]###[]
For the first and last time in our history Bulgaria is expelling 70 Russian diplomats at once and without publicly announced reasons!###26###BG_098###[]###[]###[]
"And if Petkov and Ninova do not see a problem with this shame, the Bulgarian people will not accept it!"""###29###BG_098###[]###[]###[]
, the former ombudsman wrote on Facebook.###30###BG_098###[]###[]###[]
"""Something like this has not happened since Bulgaria had modern diplomacy."###31###BG_098###[]###[]###[]
"We are talking here more about cultural attach�s, press attach�s, commercial attach�s, representatives of the Russian services disguised under other diplomatic positions, which are many and currently quite active"", former foreign minister Milen Keremedchiev told bTV."###32###BG_098###[]###[]###[]
According to him, the important thing is to find out whether these 70 expelled employees will be replaced by others or their positions will be abolished.###33###BG_098###[]###[]###[]
In his words, the note handed to Mitrofanova hints at moving towards reciprocity.###34###BG_098###[]###[]###[]
"""The Russian Federation has the largest number of diplomats in our country."###35###BG_098###[]###[]###[]
It varies up to about 150 people.###36###BG_098###[]###[]###[]
"This is more than 10 times more than our diplomats in Russia, we have 10-15 people there,"" Keremedchiev said."###37###BG_098###[]###[]###[]
"""Something the caretaker cabinet did not want"", Ninova pointed out."###8###BG_102###[]###[]###[]
"""You probably don't remember, but there was a bill to close nurseries."###9###BG_102###[]###[]###[]

She called on all those who say that Bulgaria exported weapons to Ukraine to bring out a document.###20###BG_102###[]###[]###[]
Here is a transcript from the National Assembly where I asked the current Minister of Economy, who is not a fan of mine because I fired him for corruption.###22###BG_102###[]###[]###[]
He answers from the rostrum of the parliament that the government has exported arms for 2 billion.###23###BG_102###[]###[]###[]
"Where are two, where are six?"""###24###BG_102###[]###[]###[]

Kornelia Ninova pointed out that there will be an election of the BSP chairman in a year and a half.###41###BG_102###[]###[]###[]
Congress cannot elect a president.###43###BG_102###[]###[]###[]
So after a year and a half, all contenders for the post are welcome.###44###BG_102###[]###[]###[]

Priority will also be given to the implementation of the commitments in the Recovery and Sustainability Plan, which relate to reforms in social assistance, the modernisation of the long-term care system for the elderly and people with disabilities and the creation of a digital training platform for over 500,000 people.###28###BG_161###[]###[]###[]
"""This is a basic option for discussion."###30###BG_161###[]###[]###[]
"Discussions on the issue will take place in the coming months"", he stressed."###31###BG_161###[]###[]###[]
Byala was the second larger Bulgarian settlement after Svishtov to be liberated from Ottoman rule.###3###BG_165###[]###[]###[]
It is because of this fact that it is considered the first capital of the newly liberated Bulgarian land.###4###BG_165###[]###[]###[]
The ceremony, hosted by the Mayor of the Municipality, was also attended by representatives of the Regional Administration - Ruse.###10###BG_165###[]###[]###[]
"Among the official guests were the Head of the National Military University ""Vasil Levski"" Brigadier General Ivan Malamov, the Head of the Military District - 1st Degree Lieutenant Colonel Vasil Petrov, the Head of the Regional Department of Education Dr. Rositsa Georgieva, the Director of the Secretariat of the Regional Council of the Bulgarian Red Cross Antoaneta Yabanozova, the Mayors of Dve Mogili and Borovo Bozhidar Borisov and Valentin Panayotov, a number of representatives of the local and state authorities from the region and the neighboring settlements, as well as the parish priest of Byala Father Georgi Stoyanov."###11###BG_165###[]###[]###[]
In his speech the Mayor of Byala Dimitar Slavov recalled many historical facts and noted that March 3 is a holy national holiday, not only because it is one of the first holidays that the newly liberated Bulgarian state introduced in its calendar, but because it is a symbol of the restored Bulgarian statehood.###12###BG_165###[]###[]###[]
"""Let us remember, let us be united, let us carry in our hearts the proud Bulgarian spirit, because only the love for Bulgaria can unite us and give us the strength to keep pure our brightest national ideal,"" the mayor of Byala was adamant."###19###BG_165###[]###[]###[]
The reason is that it appears on a strange date and has no patron, which is far from the original intention.###3###BG_169###[]###[]###[]
In 1916 the secular authorities adopted the Gregorian calendar.###7###BG_169###[]###[]###[]
The dates shift - April 1, 1916 according to the Julian calendar becomes April 14 according to the Gregorian calendar.###8###BG_169###[]###[]###[]
However, the Church does not accept the so-called new style, it remains on the Julian calendar.###9###BG_169###[]###[]###[]
St.###10###BG_169###[]###[]###[]
John of Rila also remains on November 1.###11###BG_169###[]###[]###[]
In 1922, an initiative group of intellectuals, including writers Ivan Vazov and Stoyan Chilingirov, professors Lyubomir Miletich and Benyo Tsonev, actresses Adriana Budevska and Elena Svezhina, proposed that November 1 - the church day of the saint, officially become the day of the national awakeners.###12###BG_169###[]###[]###[]
The name is invented by prof.###13###BG_169###[]###[]###[]
Boyan Penev.###14###BG_169###[]###[]###[]
In it is St.###18###BG_169###[]###[]###[]
John of Rila, later Ivan Vazov was added.###19###BG_169###[]###[]###[]
The celebration of the revivalists was restored in 1992.###27###BG_169###[]###[]###[]
It is recorded on 1 November - a public holiday and a non-working day for all educational institutions.###28###BG_169###[]###[]###[]
Only something has happened in the meantime.###29###BG_169###[]###[]###[]
Since 1968 the Holy Synod has adopted a reform of the Bulgarian church calendar, the so-called Corrected Julian Calendar.###30###BG_169###[]###[]###[]
The situation does not change, although two unions sew two more days - a day of Bulgarian science and a day of Bulgarian journalism.###38###BG_169###[]###[]###[]
The Principles bring together more than 190 banks from different countries, including leading global financial institutions such as Santander, Nordea, ING Bank, Commerzbank, Citi and Deutsche Bank, or more than a third of the global banking industry.###10###BG_170###[]###[]###[]
"Postbank, with the legal name ""Eurobank Bulgaria"" AD, is the fourth largest bank in Bulgaria, with a wide branch network throughout the country and a significant customer base of individuals, companies and institutions."###18###BG_170###[]###[]###[]
Postbank occupies a strategic position in retail and corporate banking in Bulgaria.###21###BG_170###[]###[]###[]
This became clear on Friday at the conclusion of the Sixth Summit of the initiative, which was held in the National Palace of Culture.###4###BG_177###[]###[]###[]
At the final press conference with the participation of the Presidents of Bulgaria, Latvia, Poland and Romania, a declaration of the meeting was presented, one of the points of which was that a public platform for the progress of the projects was created.###5###BG_177###[]###[]###[]
The. platform. in. question. does. not. give. access. to. a. description. of. the. projects. themselves,. but. the. summary. shows. that. so. far. a. total. of. 90. projects. worth. �180.9. billion. have. applied. for. funding. 49%. of. the. projects. by. value. are. transport,. 37%. are. energy,. and. 14%. are. digitisation. projects.###6###BG_177###[]###[]###[]
Poland presented the largest number of projects - 11.###10###BG_177###[]###[]###[]
During the Sofia summit, the fund's executive director Joe Phillips said that so far the projects that have been fully approved and allocated funds are two more - one in Poland and one in Estonia.###13###BG_177###[]###[]###[]
The first is for the development of the Polish locomotive leasing platform Kargoyunit, which was established in 2003 and is one of the six largest such companies in the EU.###14###BG_177###[]###[]###[]
In this, the fund bought out most of the shares of the previous private owners of the unfinished project, leaving them with less than 10% of the shares.###16###BG_177###[]###[]###[]
The final declaration from Sofia, however, does not mention these ideas.###19###BG_177###[]###[]###[]
During the debate in the plenary, the Commissioner for Financial Services, Financial Stability and Capital Markets, Mareid McGuinness, was also present on the Commission side.###11###BG_180###[]###[]###[]
It covers a number of priority areas - innovation, research, culture, education, sport, as well as preventing brain drain from the region.###15###BG_180###[]###[]###[]
"This was said by Ivan Granitski, MP from the civil quota of the BSP for Bulgaria, founder of the publishing house ""Zahari Stoyanov"", corresponding member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, for the program ""Sofia Tribune"" on Radio ""Focus""."###4###BG_181###[]###[]###[]
So, of course, it is good to adopt the date as a national holiday.###14###BG_181###[]###[]###[]
"""This should be a state strategy."###19###BG_181###[]###[]###[]
The Union of Bulgarian Writers has proposed such options, and in the last parliament VMRO also had a draft, but it has never been adopted into law.###26###BG_181###[]###[]###[]
In his words, lexical legislation should protect the language from depersonalization, from drying up, from losing its spirit.###28###BG_181###[]###[]###[]
You may recall that years ago there was research into what the language of newspapers and the media was 100 years ago.###30###BG_181###[]###[]###[]
It turned out to be more than 20 times depleted.###31###BG_181###[]###[]###[]
If 100 years ago they had 10-15 thousand vocabulary words, the current media use 800-1000 words.###32###BG_181###[]###[]###[]
It is about tragic impoverishment.###33###BG_181###[]###[]###[]
And when language is poor, it is a function of poor thought.###34###BG_181###[]###[]###[]
Ivan Granitski commented that one of the reasons for the poor vocabulary is the functional illiteracy that is observed in the graduates of secondary education in recent years.###35###BG_181###[]###[]###[]
According to him, young people are reading less and less because of the reduction of the curricula, throwing out classics from Bulgarian literature and history, which rather borders on falsification.###36###BG_181###[]###[]###[]
"""The result is sad,"" says writer Ivan Granitsky."###37###BG_181###[]###[]###[]
Swap of chief positions in BDZ###1###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
The new - old Executive Director of BDZ Georgi Drumev and Margarita Petrova-Caridi - Chairman of the Board of Directors.###2###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
There has been a change of top positions in the management of BDZ Holding.###3###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
The two take the places of Nikola Vassilev and Grigori Grigorov, who were dismissed from their posts by caretaker Transport Minister Georgi Todorov at the end of June.###5###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
Georgi Drumev and Margarita Petrova-Karidi previously joined the board of directors of the railways as independent members after a competition held by the Agency for Public Enterprises and Control.###7###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
Georgi Drumev was CEO of Holding BDZ for four months in 2017 during the caretaker government of Ognian Gerdzhikov, appointed by President Rumen Radev.###8###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
After the arrival of the third GERB cabinet he was replaced.###9###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
Before that - during the cabinet of Plamen Oresharski, which was supported by BSP and DPS, Georgi Drumev was the manager of BDZ Freight in the period 2013-2014.###10###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
The transport ministry presents him as a specialist in the field of railways with many years of experience in the system, without mentioning the positions he has held so far.###13###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
A check of public records shows that in the period 2019 - 2020.###15###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
"Georgi Drumev was the manager of the state arms factories ""Terem Khan Krem"" and ""Terem Ovech"", which is now liquidated."###16###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
Georgi Drumev graduated from the Todor Kableshkov Military Transport School with a degree in Technology and Organization of Railway Transport.###17###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
Margarita Petrova-Karidi was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors of BDZ Holding.###18###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
She graduated from Mathematical High School and the University of Economics with a degree in Banking and Corporate Finance.###21###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
It is not clear what Caridi's reason is for switching from banking to state-owned railways, which are in dire financial straits and pay significantly less.###22###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
"In addition to Georgi Drumev and Margarita Petrova-Karidi, the Board of Directors with a mandate until February 3, 2024 includes also the ""fired"" Grigori Grigorov and Svetlomir Nikolov, a reference in the Commercial Register shows."###23###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
In the announcement of the Ministry of Transport and Communications it is stated that competitions are currently held for the election of new members to fill the Board of Directors of Holding BDZ EAD.###24###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
According to unofficial information of Mediapool, the competitions are for the seats of Nikola Vassilev and Grigori Grigorov.###25###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
The two joined the board of directors in late 2018 following a decision by the then###26###BG_183###[]###[]###[]
Antoaneta Tsoneva: We need to solve the artificially created problems with...###1###BG_188###[]###[]###[]
Sofia.###2###BG_188###[]###[]###[]
This was requested by the chairwoman of the Parliamentary Committee on Policies for Bulgarians Abroad Antoaneta Tsoneva at a meeting of the committee on Wednesday.###4###BG_188###[]###[]###[]
For the academic year 2021-2022, 2150 places are planned for Bulgarians from the historical Bulgarian communities abroad.###6###BG_188###[]###[]###[]
But he admitted that the problem of permanent residents and those who came to Bulgaria with Bulgarian citizenship remained unresolved.###13###BG_188###[]###[]###[]
"""We are shooting a fly with a gun, we have to find a more direct way"", Antoaneta Tsoneva said indignantly."###15###BG_188###[]###[]###[]
In front of the parliamentary committee, Deputy Foreign Minister Velislava Petrova presented how the State Agency for Bulgarians Abroad will be integrated, which is now part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as an executive agency.###22###BG_188###[]###[]###[]
The agency's budget and staffing remain within the parameters of last year, but it must now work more closely with our consulates abroad.###23###BG_188###[]###[]###[]
Velislava Petrova said that her department was willing to make this happen and promised to start the work on the creation of public councils first in countries with larger Bulgarian communities.###29###BG_188###[]###[]###[]
Georgi Sabev:###1###BG_194###[]###[]###[]
The exchange of experience and knowledge between Member States is key###2###BG_194###[]###[]###[]
This was stated by the Deputy Minister of Agriculture Georgi Sabev during the meeting of the agricultural advisors from the EU member states.###5###BG_194###[]###[]###[]
The event was organised by the European Commission, DG Agriculture and the EIP Support Unit AGRI (European Partnership for Agricultural Innovation) and was attended by experts from the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Agricultural Advisory Service (NAAS).###6###BG_194###[]###[]###[]
"""Other challenges include improving cooperation between farmers and the processing sector, and ensuring market access for smallholder farmers through the development of short supply chains."###9###BG_194###[]###[]###[]
"Asked whether it was possible to gather Ivan Kostov, Plamen Oresharski and Simeon Djankov in a joint commission, Djankov himself was adamant - ""Yes, it is possible""."###10###BG_197###[]###[]###[]
"""Why shouldn't it be possible, these are people who have been involved in the processes of the state."###11###BG_197###[]###[]###[]
So one can also study other people's experience and see what can be used from it.###17###BG_197###[]###[]###[]
Asked whether a progressive tax will be introduced or the flat income tax will be raised from its current 10%, Djankov predicted a rise in VAT, from which much more revenue is currently collected in the budget.###22###BG_197###[]###[]###[]
He was adamant that funds for business and social security was###23###BG_197###[]###[]###[]
rather than just spending without buffers.###24###BG_197###[]###[]###[]

The first thing that the majority in the 47th National Assembly urgently dealt with was the prices of electricity, heating and water.###2###BG_202###[]###[]###[]
Prime Minister Kiril Petkov, for his part, announced that from now on the price increase will only go after a full analysis of whether everything possible has been done to reduce the costs of energy production.###6###BG_202###[]###[]###[]
"During the two-day discussions in the National Assembly about the moratorium, different interpretations were heard, for example, that with this decision we were sending messages to a ""banana republic""."###7###BG_202###[]###[]###[]
But let's see what some countries in Europe have done.###8###BG_202###[]###[]###[]
It applies for five months, from 1 November 2021 to 31 March 2022.###14###BG_202###[]###[]###[]
The aim is to bring electricity and gas prices under control.###15###BG_202###[]###[]###[]
By the way, the moratorium is one of the topics on which Prime Minister Petkov spoke in Brussels at a meeting with EC President Ursula von der Leyen.###22###BG_202###[]###[]###[]
All European governments have taken or are taking their own measures - price freezes, subsidies, VAT cuts, etc., to protect their households from flying inflation.###24###BG_202###[]###[]###[]
Just a few days ago, the NSI announced a 7.3% year-on-year increase in November - a record for the last decade.###27###BG_202###[]###[]###[]
The increase in diesel fuel is 4.3% and in gasoline - 3%.###32###BG_202###[]###[]###[]
The prospects for this market in the country and worldwide are clear.###38###BG_202###[]###[]###[]
Fact.###42###BG_202###[]###[]###[]
Let the government and the experts analyse the energy sector while the moratorium lasts.###45###BG_202###[]###[]###[]
According to the BSP deputy prof.###47###BG_202###[]###[]###[]
He did this via Facebook.###4###BG_213###[]###[]###[]
"The party will be called ""Bulgarian Rise""."###5###BG_213###[]###[]###[]
Here are her intentions.###6###BG_213###[]###[]###[]
All of us should give this assessment, as citizens and Bulgarians, with a clear awareness of the historical responsibility we bear for the future of Bulgaria and the future generations.###8###BG_213###[]###[]###[]
Incomes continue to be humiliatingly low, and high inflation rates are devaluing them further.###15###BG_213###[]###[]###[]
We are getting poorer and life is getting more expensive.###16###BG_213###[]###[]###[]
"Why ""EXIT""?!"###39###BG_213###[]###[]###[]
The battle was to remove Borissov, now should we go back, asks Atanas Atanasov.###3###BG_214###[]###[]###[]
"This is how Atanas Atanasov, the MP from ""Democratic Bulgaria"", commented in the studio of ""Hello, Bulgaria"" on Nova the turmoil in the government because of the military aid to Ukraine."###5###BG_214###[]###[]###[]
"""One thing is what will happen on the case in plenary, another is the fate of the government."###10###BG_214###[]###[]###[]
He specified that products of the Bulgarian military industry have long been on the territory of Ukraine.###13###BG_214###[]###[]###[]
He is convinced that if a secret ballot is taken - there will be 200 votes for this decision.###23###BG_214###[]###[]###[]
He explained that in this configuration of the parliament he did not see the possibility for another majority.###30###BG_214###[]###[]###[]
Asked what is the likelihood they will leave the ruling coalition, but continue to support it, Atanasov said he had said enough and that there will be a discussion on the topic on Tuesday within the DSB.###31###BG_214###[]###[]###[]
Ivanov said he wanted a coalition council of the ruling party to be convened on Tuesday to discuss the case.###34###BG_214###[]###[]###[]
The third party in the DB is the Green Movement.###35###BG_214###[]###[]###[]
It has a deputy prime minister in the person of Borislav Sandov, who is also minister of environment and water.###36###BG_214###[]###[]###[]

Even when these interests do not coincide with the interests of other major countries and European structures.###15###BG_223###[]###[]###[]
"""In addition, Minister Velkova (then Deputy Minister of A."###6###BG_225###[]###[]###[]
Vassilev), prepared the budget of the regular government for 2022 and the three-year forecast framework for 2023, 2024, 2025 to it.###7###BG_225###[]###[]###[]
This was officially stated by the Bulgarian National Bank.###14###BG_225###[]###[]###[]
Apparently startled by the stormy public reaction, yesterday Minister Rositsa Velkova softened her forecasts for a future apocalypse.###15###BG_225###[]###[]###[]
Veleva commented that the quotes from the report of the ministry were taken out of context.###17###BG_225###[]###[]###[]
A day earlier, she claimed that there was such a possibility.###19###BG_225###[]###[]###[]
"In his words, ""a loan from the IMF is a stigma that means investors forget about Bulgaria and we will finance ourselves very expensively""."###23###BG_225###[]###[]###[]
According to him, it is unrealistic the deficit to become 3% by the end of the year and the fall of the flat tax will become a fashionable topic very soon.###24###BG_225###[]###[]###[]
On the proposal to introduce a one-time solidarity contribution for the second half of this year or the so-called excess profit tax for all legal entities, Nojarov pointed out that excess profit and punishing active companies that have a positive financial result is only discussed in the planned economy.###28###BG_225###[]###[]###[]
"""What does 'solidarity contribution' mean?"###29###BG_225###[]###[]###[]
In solidarity with what?###30###BG_225###[]###[]###[]
And all this raises the budget costs.###33###BG_225###[]###[]###[]
"Is this the solidarity we are talking about?"""###34###BG_225###[]###[]###[]
, the economist asked.###35###BG_225###[]###[]###[]
Their competitiveness will be reduced as they have a lower budget than their EU and neighbouring counterparts operating or passing through Bulgarian territory.###38###BG_225###[]###[]###[]

From ministerial post to car association###1###DE_005###[]###[]###[]
According to Bild am Sonntag, former SPD chairman Sigmar Gabriel is the favorite to become head of the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA).###2###DE_005###[]###[]###[]
According to the report, details are to be clarified with Gabriel in the coming week.###7###DE_005###[]###[]###[]
The post of top lobbyist for the automotive industry needs to be filled after Bernhard Mattes announced his retirement at the end of 2019 in September.###9###DE_005###[]###[]###[]
"The former Ford manager has only been VDA President since March 2018; his term of office was originally not due to end for another year."###10###DE_005###[]###[]###[]
Gabriel was most recently Foreign Minister until March 2018, before that he was Head of the Economics Department in Berlin - and as Minister President of the car state of Lower Saxony, he also had a seat on the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen.###17###DE_005###[]###[]###[]
Gabriel is currently still a member of the Bundestag for the Salzgitter-Wolfenb�ttel constituency, but will resign his seat in the Bundestag on January 1.###18###DE_005###[]###[]###[]
November, as he had announced at the end of September.###19###DE_005###[]###[]###[]
"Turning a blind eye to the diesel scandal and slowing down e-mobility now appear in a different light."""###26###DE_005###[]###[]###[]
Shortly after leaving the chancellorship in 2005, his party comrade Gerhard Schr�der took over the chairmanship of the supervisory board of the Nord Stream Baltic Sea pipeline, which is dominated by the Russian company Gazprom.###28###DE_005###[]###[]###[]
Hildegard M�ller (CDU), who is being discussed as Gabriel's rival for the VDA post, was previously Minister of the Chancellery and a confidante of Chancellor Angela Merkel.###30###DE_005###[]###[]###[]
M�ller moved to the Federal Association of the Energy and Water Industries as Managing Director in October 2008.###31###DE_005###[]###[]###[]
Former VDA President Matthias Wissmann (CDU) was also politically active before his work as a lobbyist, most recently as Federal Minister of Transport.###32###DE_005###[]###[]###[]
At the same time, the EU is reaching out to Russia and China in the hope of being able to procure vaccines there in an emergency.###3###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
Meanwhile, the wrangling over the contracts with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical group Astrazeneca and other manufacturers continues.###4###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
"The imposition of export restrictions is a ""worrying trend"", said Mariangela Simao, who is responsible for medicines and vaccines at the WHO."###11###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
"""Vaccine nationalism may serve short-term political goals."###13###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
"""If a village is on fire, it makes no sense for a small group to hoard all the fire extinguishers to protect their own homes."" When asked by taz, the chief spokesperson for Commission President Ursula von der Leyen explained that the EU remains fully committed to the WHO and its objectives."###15###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
"The controversial export brake is not about bans, but about a ""transparent and balanced"" supply of vaccines."###17###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
"The measure could ""backfire if other countries also introduce it""."###20###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
However, in light of the coronavirus crisis, it seems to be forgetting these market-liberal principles.###22###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
The coronavirus vaccines developed there have so far not been worth mentioning to the EU.###24###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
However, on Monday the Commission admitted that talks were taking place with the Russian manufacturer.###25###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
One reason for the delay also seems to be that the EU negotiated its contracts with manufacturers later - but then also more thoroughly.###28###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
Accordingly, it is simply not possible to sue Moderna, Biontech or Pfizer, Astrazeneca or other companies in the USA if vaccination damage occurs.###30###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
Unless they would deliberately sabotage their own vaccines.###31###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
Two contracts are now public in the EU, the one with the T�bingen-based manufacturer CureVac and the one with the British-Swedish manufacturer Astrazeneca.###32###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
And the cost assumptions include exceptions.###36###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
But these of all things are blacked out in the contracts.###37###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
What exactly the companies would have to pay for in case of doubt: still unknown.###38###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
Berlin and Brussels say that the contracts with the other manufacturers contain less generous guarantees against damage claims.###39###DE_026###[]###[]###[]
Corona pandemic: Major D�sseldorf concert postponed until late fall###1###DE_031###[]###[]###[]
It was foreseeable: The planned large-scale concert with up to 13,000 guests in the D�sseldorf soccer stadium will not take place on September 4.###2###DE_031###[]###[]###[]
The major concert in D�sseldorf originally planned for September 4 with up to 13,000 spectators is to be postponed until late fall.###4###DE_031###[]###[]###[]
This was announced by the organizer on Wednesday.###5###DE_031###[]###[]###[]
NRW Health Minister Karl-Josef Laumann (CDU) welcomed the decision.###6###DE_031###[]###[]###[]

Africa aid conference in Paris: lots of money, no patents###1###DE_040###[]###[]###[]
This was announced by French head of state Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday in Paris after an Africa aid conference.###4###DE_040###[]###[]###[]
The main topic of the summit was the promotion of the economies in Africa, which are being hit hard directly and indirectly by the consequences of the Covid pandemic.###6###DE_040###[]###[]###[]

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), African countries will need around 285 billion US dollars by 2025 to counter the economic impact of the pandemic.###12###DE_040###[]###[]###[]

This in turn means that commercial vehicle manufacturers tend to produce vehicles with optimized fuel consumption and therefore do not have quite as much savings potential.###15###DE_073###[]###[]###[]

"This is no different with ""boosters""."###6###DE_104###[]###[]###[]
Nevertheless!###7###DE_104###[]###[]###[]
Unlike the noun, which is clearly borrowed from English, the verb is probably a German creation of its own, according to the press release issued by the jury headed by linguist Anatol Stefanowitsch.###8###DE_104###[]###[]###[]
"The noun booster shot stands for ""booster vaccination"", and that really doesn't sound catchy."###9###DE_104###[]###[]###[]
"The corresponding verb is actually ""to boost"", but since the beginning of January ""to booster"" has been used more frequently in English."###10###DE_104###[]###[]###[]
"What a booster for the self-confidence of the ""German language community"", because they ""recognized the potential of English well before the English language community and used it for themselves""."###11###DE_104###[]###[]###[]

Language criticism as a campaign booster.###22###DE_104###[]###[]###[]
The message can be even more important than the text, the resonance even more important than the sound.###23###DE_104###[]###[]###[]
"In contrast to the word ""booster vaccination"", the jury said that ""booster"" enables ""concise yet clear communication"" in the ""ongoing pandemic""."###24###DE_104###[]###[]###[]
Because things have to move quickly if the laboratories can no longer keep up, not to mention the federal and state governments.###25###DE_104###[]###[]###[]
"Secondly, the emphasis is - attention, message: ""on the transience of vaccination protection - we are only boosted as long as the protective effect of the booster vaccination is still sufficiently high."""###26###DE_104###[]###[]###[]

At a time when the gender debate is becoming increasingly rigid, this extremely comprehensive exhibition of Rosemarie Trockel's work is delightfully liberal.###26###DE_110###[]###[]###[]
Of course, the artist fights against the grandiose pathetic gestures of the male world of artists, but her work has truly not exhausted itself in this.###27###DE_110###[]###[]###[]
If you allow ambivalences, says Susanne Pfeffer, you cannot look at people solely from the gender context.###28###DE_110###[]###[]###[]

Today, the price board at the filling station shows an average of around 2.20 euros for a liter of E10.###13###DE_116###[]###[]###[]
However, price comparisons between the DM era and today's euro era are difficult, partly because the conversion rate fixed on New Year's Eve 1998 (1 euro = 1.95583 Deutschmarks) was based exactly on the value of the German currency at that time in relation to the other euro currencies.###14###DE_116###[]###[]###[]
But this much can already be said: the price defined as a horror vision in the song has not yet been reached, even after the price jumps following the start of the war in Ukraine.###15###DE_116###[]###[]###[]
Considering that the consumer price level has roughly doubled since 1982, the 3.10 marks accepted by singer Markus back then would correspond to a price of around 6.20 marks today ?###16###DE_116###[]###[]###[]
or the equivalent of 3.17 euros.###17###DE_116###[]###[]###[]

This week, the collecting society Corint Media (formerly VG Medien) sent a nine-page complaint to the 16 heads of the German state chancelleries.###2###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
However, this is only of secondary importance, because above all ARD and ZDF are distorting the German media market with this negligence and weakening the negotiating positions of German broadcasters and publishers vis-�-vis the digital groups in the long term.###5###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
Corint Media is for private television and radio broadcasters and a number of publishers something like Gema for musicians and composers or VG Bildkunst for photographers and filmmakers.###7###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
It ensures that royalties are paid and distributed.###8###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
Corint Managing Director Markus Runde has long been struggling with the problem that ARD and ZDF simply give away a lot of their content and associated rights.###9###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
"""This gives them a competitive advantage over others in the newly emerging rights licensing markets, which also have to finance themselves by enforcing their copyrights and ancillary copyrights."###10###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
"Why should Facebook and Google pay appropriate remuneration for zeit.de when they can use the press product tagesschau.de for free?"""###11###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
Especially now that the digital groups have reduced the advertising markets for traditional media to a fraction of their former revenues.###12###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
"""You can only afford this generous attitude if you are not dependent on such financing options."""###13###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
"""At the time, the public broadcasters had seven years to make efforts to obtain their ancillary copyrights"" It still seems a little early to complain about the squandering of a right that has not even come into force yet."###15###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
Round finds it rather too late.###16###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
There was already an ancillary copyright for the press.###17###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
"""The public broadcasters had seven years to enforce their ancillary copyrights, but simply failed to do so and did nothing to secure advantages in the presentation of their content on these large platforms."###19###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
"We want to avoid increasing this distortion of competition to the detriment of private press products and broadcasters on the one hand and license fee payers on the other when the new law comes into effect."""###20###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
The complaints in the letter, which is available to the S�ddeutsche Zeitung, are very detailed.###21###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
Corint has calculated that the ARD and ZDF radio and television stations have foregone around 4.3 million euros per year.###22###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
Corint would generate between 37 and 54 million euros per year for tagesschau.de alone.###24###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
This waiver is a problem for private-sector media such as RTL, Pro 7, but also Der Spiegel and S�ddeutsche Zeitung (which is not a member of Corint Media) primarily because the digital groups could in future be more likely to use content from providers who do not exercise their performance rights.###25###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
ARD headquarters has not yet received the complaint.###26###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
Nevertheless, a reaction comes from the WDR headquarters in Cologne.###27###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
"""From ARD's point of view, it is particularly wrong that the state broadcasters could claim the ancillary copyright of the press publisher for themselves."###29###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
You are not a protected producer of press products.###30###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
They were therefore not entitled to the ancillary copyright introduced into German copyright law in 2013.###31###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
We also informed VG Media of this at the time upon request.###32###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
The same applies to the new European ancillary copyright law, the implementation of which has just been passed by the Bundestag.###33###DE_154###[]###[]###[]
This is also only granted to press publishers for press publications.###34###DE_154###[]###[]###[]

At the same time as the press conference in Vienna, however, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer announced from Germany that the Viennese assassin had links to Germany.###18###DE_163###[]###[]###[]
However, it emerged from his statements that the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism (BVT) did not take offensive action against the assassin in Slovakia following indications of an attempted purchase of ammunition by him, but only initiated a risk assessment.###22###DE_163###[]###[]###[]
The attack could have been prevented if he had known what to do as Interior Minister, Kickl suggested to Nehammer that he should resign.###26###DE_163###[]###[]###[]
It is not about obfuscation, distraction and platitudes, it is also about taking personal responsibility, recommended party and club leader Pamela Rendi-Wagner to the �VP minister.###28###DE_163###[]###[]###[]

"Venus was probably always a hostile ""hell"""###1###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
Venus, Earth's sister planet, may never have harbored oceans.###2###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
The climate therefore did not allow water vapor to condense there.###4###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
The new findings contradict earlier estimates that there may once have been oceans on young Venus.###5###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
By comparison, there have been oceans on Earth for almost four billion years.###6###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
"A team led by astrophysicist Martin Turbet from the University of Geneva has now added another piece to the puzzle in the journal ""Nature""."###8###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
"""We simulated the climate of Earth and Venus at the very beginning of their evolution, more than four billion years ago, when the surfaces of the planets were still molten,"" Turbet is quoted as saying in a press release from the University of Geneva."###9###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
At that time, the celestial bodies resembled a gigantic pressure cooker.###10###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
And according to the researchers, the temperatures on Venus were never low enough for the water vapor in the atmosphere to condense and pour down on the planet in the form of rain.###11###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
This is because clouds, which preferentially formed on the night side of the planet, created an enormous greenhouse effect that prevented Venus from cooling down sufficiently - and thus the formation of oceans.###12###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
"The observations obtained will be crucial ""to confirm - or refute - our work,"" said Geneva professor and co-author of the study, David Ehrenreich."###15###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
"""If the authors are correct, Venus has always been a hellhole,"" write US researchers James Kasting and Chester Harman in an article accompanying the study."###16###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
"In fact, Venus today is a ""hellhole"": the thick atmosphere consists mainly of carbon dioxide, the air pressure is incredibly high and temperatures are around 470 degrees Celsius day and night."###17###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
The astrophysicists also showed in their simulations that the Earth only narrowly avoided the same fate as Venus.###18###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
If the Earth had orbited the sun just a little more closely or if our central star had shone as brightly as it does today, it would now be just as inhospitable a planet as Venus.###19###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
Third smallest planet in our solar system Venus - with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers almost as large as our Earth - is the second innermost and third smallest planet in the solar system with an average distance to the sun of 108 million kilometers.###20###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
Earth's inner neighbor orbits our central star in just under 225 days.###21###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
However, because the planet rotates very slowly on its own axis, a Venus day is longer than a Venus year at 243 Earth days.###22###DE_174###[]###[]###[]
The planet is enveloped by a closed, opaque cloud cover, its atmosphere consists mainly of carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of nitrogen, water vapor and sulfur dioxide as well as traces of gases.###23###DE_174###[]###[]###[]

Revocation of patent protection for vaccines: What industry and patent lawyers have to say###1###DE_223###[]###[]###[]
The difficult production process in mRNA technology is time-consuming and especially now, when time is of the essence, cannot be mastered simply by making changes to patent law.###3###DE_223###[]###[]###[]
In order to process the 280 components currently used from 86 suppliers from 19 countries, complex special systems and trained personnel are required.###4###DE_223###[]###[]###[]
Moderna boss St�phane Bancel takes a similar view.###5###DE_223###[]###[]###[]
The head of the US biotech company, which produces the second mRNA-based drug approved in the USA and the European Union, believes that patent approval this year or next will not really speed up availability.###6###DE_223###[]###[]###[]
"There is simply ""not enough talent in the world and not enough production facilities that can reliably guarantee complex production."""###7###DE_223###[]###[]###[]
This also takes many months.###9###DE_223###[]###[]###[]
His Moderna competitor Bancel takes a similar view.###12###DE_223###[]###[]###[]
The pharmaceutical industry, on the other hand, takes a different view: it sees vaccines more as a commodity.###14###DE_223###[]###[]###[]
"Where are saving ideas supposed to come from in the next pandemic and who is supposed to finance their implementation until they are ready for production when everyone knows that the inventors' patents will be taken away anyway?"""###16###DE_223###[]###[]###[]

Employment Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) and Development Aid Minister Gerd M�ller (CSU) are in favor of a liability mechanism and have the backing of civil society, trade unions and churches.###5###DE_230###[]###[]###[]
However, there are also companies and associations that are in principle in favor of liability.###7###DE_230###[]###[]###[]
The European brand association AIM, which represents around 2,500 companies such as Beiersdorf, Nestl� and Puma, stated with regard to a European supply chain law: companies should be able to be held liable for not having established and applied sufficient due diligence procedures.###8###DE_230###[]###[]###[]
It is necessary to finally talk about what liability could look like in order to find a compromise, says Cornelia Heydenreich from the Supply Chain Act Initiative.###10###DE_230###[]###[]###[]
In fact, the impression that only a supply chain law provides a liability basis for lawsuits is wrong.###11###DE_230###[]###[]###[]
However, Ministers Heil and M�ller actually want to define civil liability more precisely in a supply chain law and thus simplify the legal options for those affected.###13###DE_230###[]###[]###[]
This is what the original but unpublished key points of the law envisage.###14###DE_230###[]###[]###[]
Companies could protect themselves - without solving a problem.###15###DE_230###[]###[]###[]
Even companies that are generally committed to a supply chain law with enforcement mechanisms have their doubts about the usefulness of civil liability.###16###DE_230###[]###[]###[]
Companies could, for example, rely on private auditing companies to check suppliers.###18###DE_230###[]###[]###[]
Nevertheless, a compromise by the German government could include waiving extended civil liability within a supply chain law.###23###DE_230###[]###[]###[]
If companies fail to comply with due diligence obligations, fines of up to ten percent of turnover could be imposed and the company could be excluded from public procurement procedures or foreign trade promotion.###24###DE_230###[]###[]###[]
However, some of those involved wonder whether an authority could fulfill this task effectively.###26###DE_230###[]###[]###[]
Christian Socialist Development Minister Gerd M�ller is considered more flexible on this point.###29###DE_230###[]###[]###[]
He is primarily concerned with the introduction of a regulation for supply chains.###30###DE_230###[]###[]###[]
So far, Economics Minister Altmaier has made little progress on the issue of liability.###31###DE_230###[]###[]###[]

Iffeldorf is not in a particularly good position when it comes to renewable energies.###2###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
Their share of electricity and heat is only 17 and 18 percent respectively.###3###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
The main topic was the energy transition.###7###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
"Mayor Hans Lang (SPD) had announced in advance that it was ""about our path to becoming an energy self-sufficient village"" based on renewable energies."###8###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
In Iffeldorf, their share is currently 30 percent below the national average and 35 percent below the state average.###9###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
According to Lang, the majority of energy, namely 85 percent, is used for heating and hot water in Iffeldorf.###10###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
He began by making it clear that this goal could not be achieved without making savings, for example with the help of building insulation or control technology.###12###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
As a quick measure, Scharli recommended lowering the hot water temperature and the heating limit temperature on the boiler.###13###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
"""There is a lot of potential."""###14###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
Groundwater heat pumps and district solutions for local heating.###15###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
Scharli also had some special advice for Iffeldorf.###16###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
The energy consultant considers a district heating network with a central heating plant like the one in Penzberg to be impractical for Iffeldorf due to the costs and high heat losses over long distances.###18###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
However, Scharli believes it is conceivable to supply individual areas or residential districts, i.e. to rely on neighborhood solutions.###19###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
"According to him, so-called ""cold local heating"" could be an option, in which water at a temperature of ten to twelve degrees is transported into the building via a network of pipes to a heat pump."###20###DE_241###[]###[]###[]

"""There are still enough roofs available in Iffeldorf,"" he said and recommended taking a look at the district's solar register."###23###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
According to him, solar systems on south-facing facades are also a possibility.###24###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
"""It works extremely well in winter."" Perhaps there is also a corner for an open-air facility in Iffeldorf, said Scharli."###25###DE_241###[]###[]###[]

Question about wind power potential in Iffeldorf.###28###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
The subsequent discussion was very lively.###29###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
"For example, questions were asked about the wind power potential, which, according to Scharli's assessment, is ""not very high"", especially as it would also need an investor who ultimately wants to earn money."###30###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
One Iffeldorfer recommended taking a closer look at the wind atlas because of an area near the highway.###31###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
Regarding wind power, Mayor Lang explained that there is the possibility of participating in a wind turbine in another region, for example in the Allg�u, through a cooperative that is yet to be founded.###32###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
"One question at the citizens' meeting was what the municipality meant by ""energy self-sufficiency""."###33###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
"Scharli and Lang explained that the aim was to achieve ""balance sheet self-sufficiency""."###34###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
This means that the municipality generates as much energy over the year as it consumes during this period, which is not true self-sufficiency.###35###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
"Mayor has high hopes for the new ""Energy Working Group"" The mayor also addressed energy issues in his report."###36###DE_241###[]###[]###[]
"He also has high hopes for the new ""Energy Working Group"", which consists of 14 people."###40###DE_241###[]###[]###[]

"H�hle der L�wen: Ankerkraut deal with Nestl� causes a disastrous response - ""Soul sold to the devil"""###1###DE_242###[]###[]###[]
But customers and cooperation partners are not at all enthusiastic about this.###3###DE_242###[]###[]###[]
The comments under the company's announcement post are clear.###8###DE_242###[]###[]###[]
YouTube star LeFloid, who regularly inspires several million subscribers with his videos, actually had a cooperation with Ankerkraut.###12###DE_242###[]###[]###[]

Study: Bitcoin environment changed massively in 2021###1###DE_249###[]###[]###[]

After China took itself out of the game, the USA now provides over a third of the computing power for validating Bitcoin transactions.###5###DE_249###[]###[]###[]
Mining activities have also increased significantly in Kazakhstan, Russia and Canada.###6###DE_249###[]###[]###[]
However, an even broader diversification would certainly be desirable, admitted Dapp.###7###DE_249###[]###[]###[]
It remains to be seen whether other countries will join in the current year.###10###DE_249###[]###[]###[]

Surveillance with Apple Airtags: Apple, listen to the signals###1###DE_255###[]###[]###[]
They are rarely heard by the companies.###3###DE_255###[]###[]###[]
Airtags are designed to make the annoying search for or loss of keys or wallets a thing of the past Privacy advocates like Lothar Wieler and Christian Drosten have been feeling the same way for years.###4###DE_255###[]###[]###[]
They warn, repeat themselves, provide evidence for their warnings and repeat themselves.###5###DE_255###[]###[]###[]
The story of the new Airtags added to the Apple range in the summer can be summarized in a similar way.###7###DE_255###[]###[]###[]
The standard version of the Apple Airtag costs 35 euros.###10###DE_255###[]###[]###[]
The waterproof air tag contains a U1 chip with ultra-wideband technology that can be tracked via Bluetooth.###12###DE_255###[]###[]###[]
In addition, owners can now send a message to potential finders.###15###DE_255###[]###[]###[]
Basically, all locating tags work according to the same principle: at regular intervals, they send out an identifier via Bluetooth that can be used to identify them.###16###DE_255###[]###[]###[]
If a nearby smartphone receives the transmission, it links the data with its own current position and forwards it to the manufacturer.###17###DE_255###[]###[]###[]
"And now comes the Apple twist: While other manufacturers rely on as many users as possible downloading their app in order to get enough data, Apple has integrated the function directly into iOS: Every Apple mobile device that has the ""Where is?"###18###DE_255###[]###[]###[]

Although the tags constantly change their Bluetooth Mac address and encrypt their data, only the owner can then identify them.###25###DE_255###[]###[]###[]
It is practically impossible to identify the perpetrators.###26###DE_255###[]###[]###[]
A warning signal, which is intended to draw attention to secret tracking, only sounds when the tag has been out of reach of its owner for three days.###27###DE_255###[]###[]###[]
However, if the airtag reappears in the vicinity of its owner, the warning does not appear.###28###DE_255###[]###[]###[]
The warning signals to Apple did not fail to materialize back then, and now they are getting louder again.###29###DE_255###[]###[]###[]
Can the coronavirus be eradicated?###1###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
Researchers present mathematical model###2###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
According to the researchers, eradicating Covid-19 would be even easier than eradicating polio, but more difficult than eradicating smallpox.###4###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
Success depends on various factors - technical, socio-political and economic.###5###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
Eradicating Covid-19 - researchers answer this important question.###6###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
Smallpox, which was declared eradicated in 1980, received the highest average score for the feasibility of eradication, according to the scientists.###10###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
On a three-point scale with the 17 variables, smallpox was rated with an average of 2.7.###11###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
In comparison, Covid-19 had an average score of 1.6 and polio an average score of 1.5.###12###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
Coronavirus: eradication of Covid-19 possible according to researchers###13###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
In order to defeat Covid-19, Prof.###18###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
Herd immunity was therefore not necessary.###21###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
According to the scientists, the biggest challenges would be to achieve a high vaccination coverage rate against Sars-CoV2 and to adapt the vaccine to the corona mutations.###22###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
According to the researchers, the acceptance of the coronavirus vaccine is low compared to smallpox and polio.###23###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
In poorer countries, on the other hand, there are still too few vaccines to achieve the necessary vaccination rates.###25###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
Wilson and his team point out that their analysis still needs to be peer-reviewed.###27###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
An investigation into the benefits and costs of eradicating Covid-19 is also necessary.###28###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
Moreover, it is important to distinguish between eradicating a disease and reducing the infection rate in a particular geographical region.###29###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
Polio and smallpox.###30###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
Polio - poliomyelitis - polio.###31###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
There have been no cases of polio (infantile paralysis) in Germany for many years.###32###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
But the virus has still not been eradicated.###33###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
There is still a risk of contracting polio abroad.###34###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
Smallpox - leaf blisters, called Variola major, Variola vera or smallpox.###36###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
Smallpox has been officially eradicated since the 1980s.###37###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
Global vaccination programs have been terminated.###38###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
Only two WHO reference laboratories in the USA and Russia still have smallpox strains, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).###39###DE_268###[]###[]###[]
Denmark | Elections in Denmark: Narrow majority for left-wing alliance###1###DE_273###[]###[]###[]

The Social Democrats are a party for the whole of Denmark.###12###DE_273###[]###[]###[]
"Immigration did not play a role; in the EU country, there has been cross-party agreement on a restrictive immigration policy for a good 20 years."###15###DE_273###[]###[]###[]

""50,000 e-cars - that's an indictment of poverty"" Hofreiter has a bad opinion of the ""Concerted Action on Mobility"" planned by the coalition committee."###5###DE_279###[]###[]###[]
"Above all, ""more meetings with the bosses of the automotive industry are planned."###6###DE_279###[]###[]###[]
"This has little to do with a ""concerted action on mobility"","" the Green politician pointed out, noting that the Federal Minister of Transport had met the car bosses 15 times last year, but not at all with the environmental associations."###7###DE_279###[]###[]###[]

But the Grand Coalition works according to the motto, if you don't know what to do, set up a working group.###12###DE_279###[]###[]###[]
"You don't need a working group for that."""###16###DE_279###[]###[]###[]
"""The Bavarian state government has systematically ensured that the Free State is left behind when it comes to wind power"" According to Hofreiter, the fact that consumers have to pay such high electricity prices is due to the exemptions and subsidies for the industry."###17###DE_279###[]###[]###[]

"The ""Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung"", for example, wrote about him under the commentary heading ""Noise instead of debate"" that he had strongly influenced German Russia policy with his demands ""from the outside"": ""The former Ukrainian ambassador was a master at this, he once blamed Germany for many deaths in his country due to a lack of arms deliveries."""###4###DE_295###[]###[]###[]

"The Germans ""leaned back too soon"", the diplomat said in a recent interview with the Ukrainian portal NV: ""They think, well, that's it, it was a difficult birth, to put it that way, it took more than nine months, these tank births took almost a year, and now it turns out that you can breathe out, relax and put your feet up, we shouldn't expect anything else."""###7###DE_295###[]###[]###[]
"However, this was ""wrong"", said Melnyk, adding that Ukraine could expect ""larger quantities"" of weapons from Germany: ""I know that they are available."""###8###DE_295###[]###[]###[]
"In a further interview with the public television station in Ukraine, Melnyk now explained in detail why he is so present in the media: ""This is a forced step."###10###DE_295###[]###[]###[]
Germany is the fourth largest economy in the world.###13###DE_295###[]###[]###[]

"Then they tell us that they can supply 5,000 helmets, and that's after long discussions."""###16###DE_295###[]###[]###[]
The point is not that any politician there might feel attacked, but that German society understands: If the Ukrainians are using such methods, then the situation there is pretty bad.###21###DE_295###[]###[]###[]

Incidentally, Melnyk says that he is currently no longer responsible for Germany, but for Latin America, the USA and Canada.###28###DE_295###[]###[]###[]
"This means that we can use these levers both via Latin America and via the United States to promote some processes in Europe."""###30###DE_295###[]###[]###[]

Golden times for employees?###1###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
Whether around Hamburg, Halle, Stuttgart or Cologne, it's not just individual trains that are being canceled with increasing frequency, but entire train lines and S-Bahn routes.###2###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
"Sometimes for days, according to announcements on the platform ""due to short-term illness of staff"" - even long after the corona waves have subsided."###3###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
Sickness can often no longer be compensated for, especially in signal boxes and control centers.###4###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
The employees have already worked countless hours of overtime.###5###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
Staffing levels are tight.###6###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
Because traffic has been increasing for years, Deutsche Bahn actually needs additional staff.###8###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
It also hires far more than 20,000 new people every year.###9###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
But almost as many leave the company.###10###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
Not just into retirement, as the Chairman of the DB-Regio Works Council reports.###11###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
"According to Ralf Damde, they are ""leaving DB for new jobs in the catering trade, at discount stores and in all kinds of other sectors, where you can now often earn even better with more regular working hours""."###12###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
Turning your back on a crisis-proof job without fear of unemployment?###13###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
On the contrary.###15###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
There are naturally limits to wage demands.###16###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
All sectors, all qualifications.###18###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
Headhunter Marcus Reinhard used to mainly look for highly paid specialists for management positions.###19###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
Today, he searches for even simple unskilled workers in practically all sectors.###20###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
He is currently looking for professional drivers for a family business with special vehicles for the semi-automatic cleaning of waste garbage cans.###21###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
There are regular working hours, more pay than is usual for truck drivers and even continued payment of wages if the machines and their drivers are unable to work in winter when it freezes.###22###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
According to Enzo Weber from the Institute for Employment Research, this is just the beginning.###24###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
The baby boomers are gradually retiring, and by 2035 there will be around seven million fewer workers in Germany.###25###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
"""If we look at how our economy has actually grown so far, growth has been through employment expansion, and that can no longer be the strategy,"" says Weber."###27###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
Language competence takes time.###28###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
The German government wants to attract workers from non-EU countries through better integration and faster naturalization.###29###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
In professions that require a high level of language competence, however, this can only have a long-term effect.###30###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
Headhunter Reinhard, for example, knows of the case of a computer specialist who fled from Iran and was presented with a 300-page employment contract by an employer - a barely legible amount of paper.###32###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
Thanks to Reinhard's mediation, he now works in a medium-sized company that presented him with an employment contract of just three pages.###33###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
The headhunter also refers to other methods.###35###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
"Expert Weber also considers both areas to be crucial: ""If someone installs a combustion engine but loses their job due to the switch to electric vehicles, then they also have enough qualifications to install heat pumps or solar systems."""###38###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
A short training course of a few months is often sufficient.###39###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
However, our education system and the practice of job advertisements are not designed for this.###40###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
Germany must exploit all potential - to promote immigration and integration as well as full-time employment for women and to activate older workers before they retire.###41###DE_301###[]###[]###[]
We want to preserve these and correct undesirable developments.###3###DE_M_007###[]###[]###[]
The global economy has lost momentum.###5###DE_M_007###[]###[]###[]
"Politically initiated upheavals such as the ""climate rescue"" require enormous investments and restructuring and hit some sectors hard."###6###DE_M_007###[]###[]###[]
The German economy is export-oriented and dependent on the international division of labor.###10###DE_M_007###[]###[]###[]
The AfD therefore wants to return the economy to a normal development path.###12###DE_M_007###[]###[]###[]
Relieving the burden on SMEs###13###DE_M_007###[]###[]###[]
German SMEs not only provide the majority of jobs, they also form an anchor of stability for our economic structure with their flexibility and inventiveness.###14###DE_M_007###[]###[]###[]
It often achieves this without state subsidies and tax breaks, from which large corporations in particular benefit.###15###DE_M_007###[]###[]###[]
"Bailout packages worth trillions cannot replace a recovery of the real economy or bring it about overnight; instead, they will only promote redistribution in the spirit of the ""Great Transformation"" and to the detriment of our competitiveness on the global market."###17###DE_M_007###[]###[]###[]

Maintaining the multi-tier school system###7###DE_M_008###[]###[]###[]
Efficient teaching and learning is only possible if the differences in performance between pupils within a school type remain limited.###9###DE_M_008###[]###[]###[]
The Abitur must once again become a certificate of eligibility to study, and the Hauptschule or Realschule certificate must qualify students for qualified vocational training.###11###DE_M_008###[]###[]###[]

Digitization is not an end in itself###19###DE_M_008###[]###[]###[]
Schools always need modern, up-to-date IT equipment.###20###DE_M_008###[]###[]###[]
This is particularly necessary for computer science lessons and for vocational training in technical subjects.###21###DE_M_008###[]###[]###[]
However, digitalization must always be viewed under the premises of meaningfulness and making work easier.###22###DE_M_008###[]###[]###[]
To this end, binding criteria for framework curricula and internal school curricula must be defined as to how digital media can be used within the teaching-learning process in a didactically methodical and age-appropriate manner and in compliance with data protection regulations.###23###DE_M_008###[]###[]###[]

Education and migration###30###DE_M_008###[]###[]###[]
The integration of migrants is a challenge for the German education system, as many of them come from other cultural backgrounds and often from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds.###31###DE_M_008###[]###[]###[]
The AfD is urging that the level of education be taken into account as a key decision-making criterion in any future rationally managed immigration policy.###34###DE_M_008###[]###[]###[]
The experience gained in Japan can be groundbreaking in this respect.###35###DE_M_008###[]###[]###[]
The aim of schooling for school-age asylum seekers must be to prepare them for the possibility of returning to their home country.###36###DE_M_008###[]###[]###[]

Making Germany the No. 1 hydrogen country###17###DE_M_016###[]###[]###[]
CO2-neutral hydrogen plays an important role here - as a versatile energy source, flexible energy storage medium and important raw material for chemical processes.###19###DE_M_016###[]###[]###[]
Hydrogen enables decarbonization even where renewable energy cannot be used directly.###20###DE_M_016###[]###[]###[]
By establishing a European hydrogen network, we want to ensure that###27###DE_M_016###[]###[]###[]
meets future demand on the European and global hydrogen market###28###DE_M_016###[]###[]###[]
"To this end, we want to further develop the ""H2 Global"" funding concept."###30###DE_M_016###[]###[]###[]
In addition to this so-called green hydrogen, we will also accept blue hydrogen in the transition period.###32###DE_M_016###[]###[]###[]

A better exchange and a coordinated approach, for example through the creation of a federal-state commission, is an important step.###24###DE_M_023###[]###[]###[]
Integration is a permanent social and state task.###26###DE_M_023###[]###[]###[]
Integration also works best with the family.###32###DE_M_023###[]###[]###[]
We will therefore abolish work bans.###36###DE_M_023###[]###[]###[]
The situation of years of chain toleration is also an obstacle to integration and must be ended by means of a deadline regulation in order to give people a perspective.###37###DE_M_023###[]###[]###[]
Nevertheless, our ability to integrate must encompass far more than the financing of language and integration courses.###39###DE_M_023###[]###[]###[]
And it's not just about new arrivals.###40###DE_M_023###[]###[]###[]
The public sector must be a role model when it comes to integration.###42###DE_M_023###[]###[]###[]
We want to abolish existing hurdles to naturalization and also shorten the current standard residence period of eight years.###47###DE_M_023###[]###[]###[]
We want to phase out coal by 2030 at the latest.###3###DE_M_031###[]###[]###[]
For a climate-neutral society, the phase-out of nuclear and coal must be followed by a phase-out of fossil natural gas.###5###DE_M_031###[]###[]###[]
Subsidy programs and state infrastructure programs must support the conversion.###13###DE_M_031###[]###[]###[]
Electricity, gas, water and heating may not be switched off.###14###DE_M_031###[]###[]###[]
The state must not continue to support climate destruction with taxpayers' money.###19###DE_M_031###[]###[]###[]

We want to organize the energy supply close to the people and as part of public services of general interest.###24###DE_M_031###[]###[]###[]
If the coal phase-out is accelerated and a decentralized energy supply with storage systems is promoted, significantly less grid expansion will be required than is currently planned - driven by the profit interests of transmission grid and coal-fired power plant operators.###31###DE_M_031###[]###[]###[]

DIE LINKE supports a regionally oriented energy transition that is anchored in the population, for example energy cooperatives and bioenergy villages.###37###DE_M_031###[]###[]###[]

Tax relief for employees and companies###1###DE_M_032###[]###[]###[]

Tax reform for the benefit of Austrian employees must come###16###DE_M_032###[]###[]###[]
Tax relief must be provided for them.###18###DE_M_032###[]###[]###[]
As a result, the tax reform, which would have brought significant relief to Austrian employees, has also been delayed due to the fault of the �VP.###20###DE_M_032###[]###[]###[]

Education is one of the most important issues for our society.###1###DE_M_037###[]###[]###[]
However, the Austrian education system also has its challenges, particularly in the area of school education.###3###DE_M_037###[]###[]###[]
Advancing the digitalization of teaching.###11###DE_M_037###[]###[]###[]
And we want to create a standardized Austrian platform on which digital content is accessible to all Austrians.###17###DE_M_037###[]###[]###[]
The demand for skilled workers in the STEM and IT sectors will continue to rise.###19###DE_M_037###[]###[]###[]
We therefore want to introduce compulsory education: Compulsory schooling can therefore only be completed once the minimum standards have been achieved - if this is not yet the case at the end of compulsory schooling, there should be further compulsory support measures,###24###DE_M_037###[]###[]###[]
Strengthen the dual education system, more permeability for apprentices.###27###DE_M_037###[]###[]###[]
Apprenticeships are an important element of the Austrian education system.###28###DE_M_037###[]###[]###[]

Federal and contract staff can be employed in the administration of schools.###43###DE_M_037###[]###[]###[]

As part of our culture, which, alongside Judaism and the Enlightenment, has been shaped for many centuries above all by Christianity.###15###DE_M_038###[]###[]###[]
Strengthen integration through the education system.###19###DE_M_038###[]###[]###[]
The results throughout Austria also show that the measure was important to bring the immigrant pupils up to a language level so that they can follow the actual lessons in the first place.###21###DE_M_038###[]###[]###[]
The German support classes are to be continued in the future.###22###DE_M_038###[]###[]###[]
While language acquisition is a basic requirement, there are of course many other elements that are important for successful integration.###23###DE_M_038###[]###[]###[]

In this very difficult time for our European partners, I believe that Cyprus must come in solidarity and help by giving the opportunity to European citizens to spend a large part of the upcoming difficult winter in a country, like ours, with high temperatures and imperceptible winter for them.###6###EL_003###[]###[]###[]
Therefore, I propose and ask the government to elaborate as soon as possible and submit to the European Union, a programme for hosting European citizens during the winter months, in our hotels and in the rest of our tourist infrastructure, at a very low cost, subsidized by the Republic of Cyprus and by European funds.###7###EL_003###[]###[]###[]
That is why the hosting of European citizens, in the framework of such a programme, should be done either at or below cost prices, provided that the necessary funding is secured.###9###EL_003###[]###[]###[]
Apart from the benefits that such a programme will have for European citizens themselves, it will also contribute decisively to energy savings by European households, which will greatly facilitate the efforts of European governments to reduce energy consumption.###10###EL_003###[]###[]###[]
Therefore, I propose that this proposal be put forward directly by our government to the European institutions, with the parallel proposal that it be extended to other European Mediterranean countries, which have similar or similar climatic conditions and tourist infrastructure to Cyprus.###11###EL_003###[]###[]###[]
At the same time, the Republic of Cyprus should promote this proposal to the Mediterranean European countries, also through the Med 7 institution, of which it is a member.###12###EL_003###[]###[]###[]
A similar programme specifically covering British citizens could be pursued in cooperation with the British government, as a minimum return for their steady preference for the Cypriot tourist market.###13###EL_003###[]###[]###[]
It goes without saying that the implementation of such a programme will bring benefits to the Cypriot society and economy, (expansion of hotel and other tourist units, reduction of the period of unemployment benefit payment to employees of the tourism industry, continuation of air routes to several destinations and more), but I repeat that in no way should it be and is not the intended purpose of my proposal.###14###EL_003###[]###[]###[]

"""I don't believe at all in the tax policy that is being pursued now."###6###EL_019###[]###[]###[]

Given that the likelihood of such an adverse scenario is not zero, the ECB seems to be exploring all options well ahead of the possible evolution of NPLs, which takes place after a time lag, the house notes, pointing out that most EU banks' first-quarter results for the first quarter did not record significant increases in the NPL ratio.###11###EL_167###[]###[]###[]
Unique findings from the prehistoric city of Akrotiri of Thera (Pics)###1###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
The excavation is being carried out under the supervision of the Ephorate of Cyclades Antiquities and with the funding of Kaspersky.###3###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
It was placed in a clay urn, next to a pile of animal horns.###5###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
Also, faience newtos and nautilus models, a crystal oreo nugget in the shape of an octagonal shield, with remnants of red thread in the suspension hole.###7###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
The above items were found under the footprint of a wooden structure, and may have been suspended from it.###8###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
In the fills, at the end of the doorways of Area 1, rosettes were found, probably on wooden elements.###9###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
Particularly emblematic is the inlaid fragment of a model of a tritone.###10###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
The inscription, consisting of Linear A syllabaries and an ideogram, is written in ink and is presumably related to the use of the building.###11###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
Loose layers of sea sand with small pebbles, gravel and soil on the floor of site 1 were attributed by geologist C.###12###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
Vougioukalaki in tidal wave deposits (tsunami) that preceded the volcanic eruption.###13###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
In Site 2, around the southern and western flank of the Kerata deposit, the sockets of at least six wooden piles were revealed, in which plaster was injected to create casts.###14###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
From the excavation data it is deduced that the piles created a kind of grate on which the horns were deposited.At the base of the grate, mixed with horns, stone tools and utensils were found, such as 43 small open vases and 2 closed ones, while in direct connection with them, remains of fabrics and charred fruits were found.###15###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
The dating of some vases to the Late Cycladic 1a period confirms that the building was in use and function until the final destruction of the city.###16###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
To the west of the Keratheotis of Kerata another pair of clay cisterns was uncovered: the larger, inverted one.###17###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
Inside the smaller one was encased, inside which, in the clay, a wooden box had been sunk, as its imprint testifies.###18###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
Inside this box was kept a marble Early Cycladic figurine of a female figure of the Spedos variant in a supine position, incomplete at the neck with the head and at the legs from the knees downwards.###19###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
The inner walls of both the clay boxes and the wooden box are coated with a bright red colour.###20###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
In the south-western part of Area 2, two clusters of microcylindrical Early Cycladic vases came to light underneath crushed floor slabs, fragments of stone tools and marine pebbles.###21###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
One consisted of 16 vases placed around a wooden object, the form of which it is hoped to determine after the plaster cast of its footprint has been retrieved.###22###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
The second cluster consisted of 131 small vessels in a shallow cavity on the floor.###23###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
Similar types of vases have been found earlier both in the wider area of the House of the Thranians and in the earlier phase of the settlement under the Square of the Cenotaph - an area probably associated with funerary worship.###24###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
The small size of these vases, their coarse construction, their number, but also the total absence of parallel grave goods in Early Cycladic tombs, suggest that they were mass-produced vessels for a specific purpose.###25###EL_173###[]###[]###[]
Their concentration in the above areas, with their strong symbolism, supports their interpretation as drinking vessels during the process of mass ritual acts.###26###EL_173###[]###[]###[]

"Are we all ""hybrid workers""?"###7###EL_178###[]###[]###[]
Has the era of the traditional office finally come to an end?###8###EL_178###[]###[]###[]
In 2018, in the UK alone, according to the Office for National Statistics, flexible working had increased by 74% year-on-year, while other surveys show that 90% of workers would prefer to work from home at least some days of the week.###11###EL_178###[]###[]###[]
Google and Facebook have announced that their telecommuting policies will continue, while Twitter will allow certain employees to work from home permanently.###13###EL_178###[]###[]###[]
It is unlikely, however, that the concept of the office will disappear altogether.###15###EL_178###[]###[]###[]
Professor Andr� Spicer told the BBC that although he predicts a sharp drop in the time workers spend there, the work of the office will continue.###16###EL_178###[]###[]###[]
And the fact is that offices provide some elements that are impossible to replace remotely: from face-to-face meetings to informal networking activities.###17###EL_178###[]###[]###[]
"Journalist Oliver Ralph wrote in the Financial Times, ""When small businesses get back on their feet, they will probably look for more flexible spaces that offer smaller contracts and more options to grow or shrink space."###19###EL_178###[]###[]###[]
"Many have discovered that they can indeed work from home, but that doesn't mean they will always want to."""###20###EL_178###[]###[]###[]
CBRE estimates the cost of an office at �14,000 a year, almost half the salary of an employee in Great Britain.###21###EL_178###[]###[]###[]

Cork council chief admits retrofitting schemes are 'bamboozling'###1###EN_035###[]###[]###[]

It also targets the installation of 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes by 2030.###3###EN_035###[]###[]###[]
According to Environment Minister Eamon Ryan's figures last month, almost 49,700 applications for heating upgrade support were submitted to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in 2022, a 150% increase on 2021 figures.###4###EN_035###[]###[]###[]

A target of 37,000 retrofits has been set for 2023, he added.###8###EN_035###[]###[]###[]
"The nature of various schemes has been criticised anecdotally by would-be consumers as unwieldy and head-scratching at times, while TDs and senators have told Mr Ryan and SEAI officials at various Oireachtas hearings that there are not enough firms under the SEAI's ""one-stop shop"" model to cope with the demand."###9###EN_035###[]###[]###[]
Mr Ryan told the Irish Examiner last month that the current low number of one-stop shops assigned by the SEAI to carry out the retrofitting programme would improve as the national programme gains momentum.###10###EN_035###[]###[]###[]
He said: �They are ramping up, and they�re not small firms � this is the likes of ESB and Scottish and Southern [SSE] � they�re not companies without scaling-up capabilities.###11###EN_035###[]###[]###[]
It does take time.###12###EN_035###[]###[]###[]

The strange link between the sterilization of wild horses and mRNA vaccines###1###EN_036###[]###[]###[]
The pharmacological effect of the vaccination does not occur right away, but gradually over a period of 2-6 weeks, similar to the Covid vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer, and requires subsequent booster vaccinations. �###2###EN_036###[]###[]###[]
The zona pellucida (ZP) is a glycoprotein membrane that surrounds all mammalian eggs.###3###EN_036###[]###[]###[]
Certain proteins in the membrane serve as the sperm receptor.###4###EN_036###[]###[]###[]
The contraceptive vaccine produced by the SCC uses the ZP from the pig, thus the name porcine zona pellucida (PZP).###5###EN_036###[]###[]###[]
�Briefly, the PZP is produced by a complex process whereby the ZP is removed from the ovum, its glycoproteins extracted, isolated, and converted into a vaccine.###6###EN_036###[]###[]###[]
The vaccine stimulates the target animal to produce antibodies, which attach to its own ZP, thus blocking fertilization and causing contraception.###7###EN_036###[]###[]###[]
�The PZP vaccine is usually given, initially, in a series of 2 vaccinations 2-6 weeks apart and then a booster every 8 months to a year, depending on the species.###8###EN_036###[]###[]###[]
The PZP is emulsified with an adjuvant to stimulate the animal�s immune system.�###9###EN_036###[]###[]###[]
It is extracted from the ovaries of pigs which is used as a source of antigens for immunocontraception.###10###EN_036###[]###[]###[]
Porcine zona pellucida has been used in wildlife contraception since the late 1980s.###11###EN_036###[]###[]###[]
Animals with which PZP has been employed in this context include elephants, wild and/or feral horses, elk and white tailed deer.###12###EN_036###[]###[]###[]
It can be administered to captured animals via a standard syringe or administered to free ranging wildlife with a dart gun.###13###EN_036###[]###[]###[]

New Jersey UFO Sighting Turns Out to Be Goodyear Blimp###1###EN_101###[]###[]###[]

Job Recruiter Proclaims That Vaccination Status Could Be an 'Incentive for Hiring'###1###EN_127###[]###[]###[]

New Jersey Governor's Race Could Slip Into Recount Margin, GOP Candidate's Lawyer Says###1###EN_128###[]###[]###[]

Cork Life Centre �deeply disappointed� with review of out-of-school education system###1###EN_129###[]###[]###[]
The Review of Out-of-School Education Provision was published on May 12, with Minister for Education, Norma Foley , announcing that a group would be set up to oversee implementation of its recommendations, which include a standardised referral framework and better data recording and tracking of students who are expelled or absent from school.###3###EN_129###[]###[]###[]
The Cork Life Centre was one of 23 organisations delivering out-of-school education that contributed to the review, but it claimed the report contained factual �inaccuracies�, and queried why it was only being published now when it was understood to have been completed in 2019.###4###EN_129###[]###[]###[]
The Cork Life Centre focuses on long-term intervention for 12- to 16-year-olds.###5###EN_129###[]###[]###[]
Picture: Howard Crowdy.###6###EN_129###[]###[]###[]
�It is an understatement to say that the report has been received with disappointment and frustration by the board, management, and staff of the Cork Life Centre,� it said of the report.###7###EN_129###[]###[]###[]
�Our view is that it is shaping the problem to fit the system, when in fact it should be the other way around.###8###EN_129###[]###[]###[]
�The review's recommendations focus on short-term interventions and do not include provision of education to children after the age of 16 or delivery of the Leaving Certificate.�###9###EN_129###[]###[]###[]
Given that Cork Life Centre and others run a service based on long-term intervention for 12- to 18-year-olds and delivers the Leaving Certificate to approximately 12 students per annum, it added �it seems very unclear how this review will progress proper funding of our service in Cork�.###10###EN_129###[]###[]###[]
�It does not address the input and needs of students who find themselves outside the mainstream system.###13###EN_129###[]###[]###[]
It also described as an �egregious misrepresentation� the claim in the report that �the Leaving Cert was not as prominent in the data returned�, outlining how 28 students achieved the Leaving Certificate in the three years from 2014 to 2017 at the Cork Life Centre.###15###EN_129###[]###[]###[]
Earlier this month, Minister Foley had said: �While this review finds positively on the work which is carried out in out-of-school settings, it is important to provide stability to this provision and ensure settings are sustainable into the future.�###16###EN_129###[]###[]###[]
Governments and consumers will end up paying for large amounts of expensive European gas stored over winter as wholesale prices plunge Prices have dropped by more than 80% from their August peak, meaning sales from inventories could come at a loss of billions of euros to energy users and taxpayers.###1###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
�Traders inject during summer believing that prices will be higher in winter, but that just didn�t happen,� said Sindre Knutsson, vice president at Rystad Energy.###2###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
�At the end, it is the consumer paying for all this.�###3###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
In a sense, Europe is a victim of its own success.###4###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
Stockpiles might even end the winter above 50%, double the level last year, according to several analysts.###8###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
To protect themselves against price volatility, companies can hedge and engage in contracts to buy and sell gas at pre-determined prices.###10###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
Traders and utilities can still take a hit on price differences, though such losses generally aren�t disclosed.###11###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
Some purchases last summer were made by companies using state aid, especially in Germany, the largest consumer.###12###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
�They will be losing money on any gas withdrawn from storage now and sold spot,� said Trevor Sikorski, head of natural gas, coal and carbon at Energy Aspects.###14###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
�This loss is just to be borne by taxpayers rather than shareholders.�###15###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
Germany�s Trading Hub Europe, set up by gas grids to serve as a market manager, had access to �15bn in government support to buy inventories at practically any cost to fill the gap left by Russia.###16###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
The firm was deeply exposed to the spot market and collects charges to cover the costs associated with the task of filling storage.###17###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
�We bought and sell at current market prices.�###19###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
Soaring market prices last summer, a time of year when gas isn�t used for heating and prices are normally lower than in winter, cost buyers in the European Union dearly.###20###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
Much of that fuel was put into storage.###22###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
Benchmark futures are now trading just above �50, near the lowest levels since September 2021.###23###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
Morgan Stanley said earlier this month that prices are likely to fall further, with stockpiles in key EU members ending the heating season at 59% full on average.###24###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
That could spell more bad news for anyone looking to sell gas from inventories.###25###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
�If buyers did not hedge the volumes they stored last summer, they will try to keep that gas in storage until prices potentially rise next winter or further in the future,� said BloombergNEF analyst Stefan Ulrich.###26###EN_132###[]###[]###[]
However, �it seems unlikely that buyers will be able to recoup their buying costs in full unless the market dramatically tightens�. - Bloomberg.###27###EN_132###[]###[]###[]

Wittenberg church to face German Supreme Court over �Jew sow�###1###EN_136###[]###[]###[]
The plaintiff is Michael Dietrich D�llmann, a member of the Jewish community in Bonn.###2###EN_136###[]###[]###[]
He has already gone through two instances, but at 78, he is not backing down.###4###EN_136###[]###[]###[]
D�llmann wants to remove the relief from the fa�ade of the main church of the Reformation and have it moved to the Luther House Museum in Wittenberg together with a historical-critical classification.###5###EN_136###[]###[]###[]
�The Wittenberg �Jew sow� has been controversial for some time.###7###EN_136###[]###[]###[]
For this reason, it has been expanded into a �Place of Remembrance� since 1988, and a memorial plaque embedded in the ground refers to the victims of National Socialism.###8###EN_136###[]###[]###[]
In addition, there is an explanatory panel on the relief as well as a cedar from Israel as a �sign of reconciliation�.###9###EN_136###[]###[]###[]
But this is not enough for the convert.###10###EN_136###[]###[]###[]
Plaintiff D�llmann keeps citing new complaints and has also been able to win over other allies in the fight against the unloved pictorial work, such as Friedrich Kramer, Bishop of Central Germany, Klaus Holz, Secretary General of the Protestant Academy, Felix Klein, the Federal Government�s anti-Semitism commissioner.###11###EN_136###[]###[]###[]
However, Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, does not want to join the call for the sculpture�s removal.###12###EN_136###[]###[]###[]
D�llmann is unperturbed by this obstacle.###13###EN_136###[]###[]###[]
He said he eventually wanted to go all the way to the European Court of Human Rights.###14###EN_136###[]###[]###[]

'Controversy over rubber bullets isn't new - I watched an RUC officer fire one point blank at Sean Downes'###1###EN_139###[]###[]###[]
But controversy over the plastic bullets is hardly new.###4###EN_139###[]###[]###[]
Indeed, for anyone in Northern Ireland who lived through the Troubles, it will be intimately familiar.###5###EN_139###[]###[]###[]
The plastic bullet was an invention of the British security forces, developed in the early 1970s to deal with disorderly crowds, and Northern Ireland became something of a laboratory for their use.###6###EN_139###[]###[]###[]
As a CNN correspondent back then, it was something I witnessed myself.###7###EN_139###[]###[]###[]
On 12 August, 1984, I stood with my camera crew outside Sinn F�in headquarters in West Belfast and watched a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary fire a plastic bullet at point blank range into the chest of demonstrator Sean Downes.###8###EN_139###[]###[]###[]
He died as our camera recorded the scene.###9###EN_139###[]###[]###[]
Permanent brain damage.###11###EN_139###[]###[]###[]
Four inches long, one and a half inches in diameter, and weighing five ounces, the plastic bullet had been designed as a less lethal tool for riot control than so-called live bullets, able to deliver a knock-down blow without entering the body.###12###EN_139###[]###[]###[]
Meant to be fired from a distance and below waist level, it was often the weapon of first resort for security forces in breaking up demonstrations or disturbances.###13###EN_139###[]###[]###[]

It was just one of many cases in which Boyle was ahead of his time.###20###EN_139###[]###[]###[]
He had represented the widow of a man shot and killed by soldiers after they had issued nothing more than a verbal warning to stop.###22###EN_139###[]###[]###[]
He had sought to use the Strasbourg machinery in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to mediate during the 1981 IRA hunger strikes.###23###EN_139###[]###[]###[]

Potentially lethal.###29###EN_139###[]###[]###[]
At an international tribunal the two activist priests organised in Belfast, with participants from Britain and the US joining concerned local citizens, Boyle submitted an eight-page paper in which he argued that the policies of the British army and Royal Ulster Constabulary governing the use of plastic bullets raised serious legal questions.###30###EN_139###[]###[]###[]
The paper began by taking issue with the government�s use of the antiseptic-sounding term �baton rounds� to describe the bullets.###31###EN_139###[]###[]###[]
This, he noted, was deliberately being done to portray the plastic bullet as �defensive in nature and restrained in its capacity to cause injury�.###32###EN_139###[]###[]###[]

California prosecutors to seek death penalty in 'Golden State Killer' murders###1###EN_147###[]###[]###[]

Efforts to suppress public memory of the Tiananmen events have lately turned to Hong Kong, where the June 4 Museum was closed this week and police again warned residents not to attend the vigil.###9###EN_205###[]###[]###[]
But the action comes amid sweeping moves to quell dissent in the city, including a new national security law, election changes and arrests of many activists who participated in pro-democracy protests that swept across Hong Kong in 2019.###11###EN_205###[]###[]###[]
Hong Kong police in vehicles and on foot cordoned off parts of Victoria Park, including football pitches and basketball courts, to prevent any unauthorised gatherings.###12###EN_205###[]###[]###[]

China Says Radiation Has Not Escaped Taishan Nuclear Plant: 'There Is No Leak'###1###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
In the point-by-point rebuttal, the ministry said elevated levels of specific activityradioactivity per unit volume or weightwere detected from the primary circuit coolant during the running of reactor Unit 1.###2###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
The amount was within the acceptable range of the plant's operational requirements.###3###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
"The increase in radioactivity in the primary circuit was the result of damage to fuel rod housings, an ""uncontrollable factor in the production, transportation and loading of fuel,"" the statement explained."###5###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
A minimum amount of fuel rod damage is unavoidable, it said, noting that the phenomenon was common and has not affected nuclear plant operations in other parts of the world.###6###EN_206###[]###[]###[]

"The ministry appeared to suggest a misinterpretation of China's nuclear safety practices in CNN's report, which it called ""not factual."""###14###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
The country's nuclear agency did not revise acceptable radiation limits outside the Taishan plant, but rather reviewed and approved a relevant limit for the specific activity of insert gases from the reactor coolant of Unit 1, it said.###15###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
"""The limit is used for operational management and is not related to radioactivity outside the nuclear power plant."###16###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
"The concept in CNN's report is erroneous,"" the statement added."###17###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
The ministry estimates around five of the reactor's 60,000 fuel rod housings are currently degraded.###18###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
"It said the ratio represents less than 0.01 percent and is ""far lower"" than the maximum 0.25 percent accounted for during the design process."###19###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
The Environment Ministry said it would continue to monitor levels of radioactivity inside the primary circuit of Unit 1 as well as outside the Taishan facility.###20###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
The authorities remain in communication with the International Atomic Energy Agency and French nuclear safety regulators, it said.###21###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
"Monday's explosive CNN report said the U.S. government was assessing two memos by utility firm Framatome, which claimed one of the two nuclear reactors at the Taishan plant was ""leaking fission gas,"" and that China's top nuclear authority was modifying safety standards to avoid a shutdown."###22###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
The French companya subsidiary of EDFdesigned and jointly operates the site in Guangdong, China's most populous province with around 115 million residents.###23###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
Framatome's contact with the U.S. government raised eyebrows and appeared to elevate the urgency of the matter.###24###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
Subsequent reports revealed that the plant's majority owner, China General Nuclear Power Group, was on the U.S. entity list.###25###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
This means that Framatome required a U.S. waiver to provide technical assistance at the plant, where the reactors were connected to the grid in December 2018 and September 2019, respectively.###26###EN_206###[]###[]###[]
"Reached by Newsweek on Monday, a Framatome spokesperson said it was ""supporting resolution of a performance issue with the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong Province, China."""###27###EN_206###[]###[]###[]

Never since 1950 have central banks increased their gold reserves as much as in 2022, with net purchases totaling 1,136 tons.###30###EN_233###[]###[]###[]
Three aspects require particular attention.###31###EN_233###[]###[]###[]
A breakdown of gold purchases by quarter shows that three quarters of gold purchases by central banks in 2022 were made in the second half of the year.###32###EN_233###[]###[]###[]
Since, as in previous years, it was mainly non-Western central banks that increased their gold holdings, this can be interpreted as a very quick reaction on the part of central banks to the freezing of Russian US dollar and euro currency reserves.###33###EN_233###[]###[]###[]

Biden Tells CDC to Consider Eviction Moratorium Options After Congress Fails to Act###1###EN_238###[]###[]###[]
"""I told the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] to go back and consider what options may be available,"" Biden told reporters Tuesday."###4###EN_238###[]###[]###[]
"""The CDC will announce that and any details of how it works."""###5###EN_238###[]###[]###[]
Biden said he's hoping that it will be a new moratorium that will cover about 90 percent of renters.###6###EN_238###[]###[]###[]
"""House Democrats stand ready to work with the Administration as they search for ways to extend the moratorium and as they urge states and localities to spend the $46.5 billion that Congress allocated,"" Pelosi said in a statement ahead of Biden's announcement."###9###EN_238###[]###[]###[]
The eviction moratorium initially was put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a public health measure to combat the pandemic and slow the virus' spread.###12###EN_238###[]###[]###[]
After the eviction ban was challenged in a lawsuit, the U.S.###13###EN_238###[]###[]###[]
But the Biden administration cited the high court's order as an indication that Congress would need to act for it to go beyond that.###15###EN_238###[]###[]###[]
U.S. House leaders spent much of Friday trying to hash out an extension agreementfirst for one through December and then shifting to one that would go to mid-Octoberbefore negotiations ultimately fizzled.###16###EN_238###[]###[]###[]
The chamber is now out of session for the regularly scheduled August recess, but members have been put on notice to be prepared to possibly return to the Capitol.###17###EN_238###[]###[]###[]
Officials have pointed to the rental assistance funds that lawmakers tucked into a COVID-19 relief package earlier this year as a way to prevent evictions, but of the $46 billion Congress allocated to state and local governments, officials estimate just $3 billion has gone out.###18###EN_238###[]###[]###[]
Several state and local governments, including California, the District of Columbia and New Jersey, have instituted their own eviction moratoriums that remain in effect.###19###EN_238###[]###[]###[]
The Biden administration estimated that about a third of people who would be affected by the federal ban's expiration would still be covered under those local moratoriums.###20###EN_238###[]###[]###[]

International human rights group seeks arrest of ex-Sri Lankan president after he fled country###1###EN_240###[]###[]###[]
Gotabaya Rajapaksa was ousted from office over his country�s economic collapse and fled to Singapore earlier this month.###2###EN_240###[]###[]###[]
He was defence secretary during Sri Lanka�s civil war, which ended in 2009.###3###EN_240###[]###[]###[]
The International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) � an evidence-gathering organisation administered by a South Africa-based non-profit foundation � said its lawyers filed the complaint requesting Rajapaksa�s immediate arrest.###4###EN_240###[]###[]###[]
Months of protests have focused on the Rajapaksa political dynasty, which has ruled the country for most of the past two decades.###7###EN_240###[]###[]###[]
�This complaint recognises that it�s not just about corruption and economic mismanagement but also accountability for mass atrocity crimes.�###9###EN_240###[]###[]###[]
Sri Lanka�s civil war killed 100,000 people, according to conservative United Nations estimates.###10###EN_240###[]###[]###[]
The actual number is believed to be much higher.###11###EN_240###[]###[]###[]
A report from a UN panel of experts said at least 40,000 ethnic minority Tamil civilians were killed in the final months of the fighting alone.###12###EN_240###[]###[]###[]
After Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country earlier this month, parliamentarians elected former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to serve the remainder of his presidential term.###16###EN_240###[]###[]###[]
Rights groups have urged the president to immediately order troops and police to cease use of force and said Friday�s display seemed to follow a pattern of Sri Lankan authorities forcefully responding to dissent.###18###EN_240###[]###[]###[]

UBS shares storm back to pre-SVB levels with post-deal surge###2###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
UBS Group AG shares have erased almost all of the losses made during the past week�s banking rout, with a bond buyback announced Wednesday adding to confidence that the historic takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG will be a net positive for the firm.###4###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
The Swiss lender is leading gains among European banks this week, as fears around the stability of the finance sector eased after the �3bn emergency takeover.###5###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
The stock pared gains to trade flat at 19.39 cents as of 11:51 a.m. in Zurich, but is about 14% higher since the Sunday agreement brokered by the Swiss government.###7###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
Bonds are up between 1-5 cents from Monday�s lows across the board.###8###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
The last-minute merger brokered by the Swiss government on Sunday has left investors racing to break down the implications for UBS, one of the world�s largest wealth managers.###9###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
For now, the benefits in terms of potential cost-savings and dramatically improved market share are outweighing concerns about the complexity of integrating Credit Suisse and the risks on its balance sheet.###10###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
�Market sentiment seemed to have turned positive, with the risk of other European banks impacted by an outright failure of Credit Suisse subsiding,� said Johann Scholtz, an equity analyst at Morningstar Inc.###11###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
�UBS�s gains yesterday reflect our view that this can be a favourable deal for UBS in the long term.###12###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
In the short term, volatility should remain in the European banking space.�###13###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
US bank shares have also been stabilizing from a selloff generated by troubles at regional lenders and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, following reassurances from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that the government could intervene to protect the broader US banking system.###14###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
�The biggest pressure point or danger is market participants conflating these events into a 2008 crisis narrative when we do not view it as that at all,� said David Storm, chief investment officer for RBC Wealth Management.###15###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
Earlier Wednesday, the Swiss lender announced it is offering to buy back �2.75bn worth of bonds it issued to investors just days before rescuing Credit Suisse.###16###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
Credit Risk UBS�s credit risk has been jolted since concern over Credit Suisse�s fate, and the role UBS would play in it, roiled global markets.###17###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
After the deal was announced, the cost of insuring UBS�s debt for one year soared to a record.###18###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
On Wednesday UBS�s credit default swaps fell further from Monday�s highs.###19###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
Yet, UBS Group�s five-year CDS remain at elevated levels.###20###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
The buyback decision was a �reasonable action to give investors the option to sell back the bonds should they, having known what they know now, have chosen not to invest,� said Andrew Wong, a credit analyst at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.###21###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
UBS is taking a selective approach to the staff and assets it has inherited from Credit Suisse.###22###EN_241###[]###[]###[]
The lender wants to cherry-pick top dealmakers from Credit Suisse Group AG�s investment bank instead of supporting Michael Klein�s plan to build a new independent firm, according to people familiar with the discussions.###23###EN_241###[]###[]###[]

Irish investors consider �238m sale of De Beers� Mayfair flagship###1###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
Investors with Dublin-based BCP Asset Management could be in line for a significant boost from the company�s boom-era investment in a prime property in London�s exclusive Mayfair district.###2###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
According to CoStar News, BCP is weighing the potential disposal of De Beers� flagship diamond jewellery store at 45 Old Bond Street for �210 million (�238 million).###3###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
That price is �177.5 million (�201.3 million) more than the �32.5 million (�46.8 million) the company paid for the property in 2004.###4###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
BCP acquired the building on behalf of the Irish Life/BCP Property Fund and BCP private investors.###5###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
Although BCP has yet to decide if it will proceed, CoStar reports that the company instructed a leading London real-estate adviser, Michael Elliott , to approach a number of potential investors last month over a sale of the building, for a net initial yield of 2.83 per cent.###6###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
When BCP acquired the property, 15 years ago, its purchase price equated to an initial yield of 5.2 per cent.###7###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
CoStar adds that there is no guarantee the building will sell.###8###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
Referring to sources, it notes that the owner is �as likely to keep the asset as agree a sale�.###9###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
BCP declined to comment when contacted by The Irish Times.###10###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
This is on par with the level recorded in 2017, highlighting the depth of demand for London�s commercial assets.�###13###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
No 45 Old Bond Street occupies one of the most sought-after retail locations in the world.###14###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
Most of the building�s retail space is let to De Beers until November 2021.###15###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
There is said to be potential to add value by converting the building�s first-floor offices to retail and from reconfiguring the existing retail space to create four new units.###16###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
BCP manages �760 million in direct real estate focused on the central London and central Dublin markets.###17###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
Apart from 45 Old Bond Street, its investments in London include prime commercial properties on New Bond Street and Oxford Street.###18###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
In Dublin, the company�s retail and office portfolio includes Nassau House and Morrison Chambers, on Nassau Street, the Fumbally Lane office complex in Dublin 8, and Block R at Eastpoint Business Park, in Dublin 3.###19###EN_243###[]###[]###[]
T he business said investors were simply not expressing sufficient interest in pouring money into the troubled lender.###3###EN_248###[]###[]###[]
As things look now, bosses think they will be unable to raise the money needed under the terms of a scheme given the thumbs up by the High Court last year.###4###EN_248###[]###[]###[]
However, on Thursday bosses said they have �not received sufficient aggregate indications of interest to cover the total amount�.###6###EN_248###[]###[]###[]
They are trying to cook up a second plan, which would see customers get less compensation and only require current investors to put in a further �6 million on top of what interested investors have promised.###8###EN_248###[]###[]###[]
But, Amigo said, even if they manage to convince investors, they will also need approval from customers and the High Court.###9###EN_248###[]###[]###[]
The business previously said investors were not showering it with cash.###12###EN_248###[]###[]###[]
Amigo specialised in subprime guarantor loans � the type where a borrower�s friends or family promise they will pay back the loan if the borrower cannot.###13###EN_248###[]###[]###[]
Customers would borrow at interest rates of around 50%.###14###EN_248###[]###[]###[]
Amigo did not.###16###EN_248###[]###[]###[]
The regulator said it would have fined Amigo nearly �73 million � but decided not to because that would take away from the compensation customers would get.###19###EN_248###[]###[]###[]
IRELAND�S CONSUMER WATCHDOG is to carry out �considerable� consumer research into pricing strategies used by utility and financial companies, such as those in the insurance industry.###2###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) chief executive, Fergal O�Leary, will tell the Oireachtas Finance Committee today that it will look at the incidence of switching and price checking.###3###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
O�Leary says �businesses increasingly know that many consumers don�t have the time or the ability to switch so consumers experience successive price increases� known as �price walking�.###5###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
The impact of rollover contracts will also be investigated.###7###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
Dual-pricing The subject of today�s meeting is dual-pricing in the insurance industry.###8###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
Two months ago, the committee said it was launching an investigation into the practice by some insurance firms of charging current customers higher rates on renewal than the rates offered to new clients.###9###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
Doherty said his own insurance company charged him a renewal price of �856 and he was quoted a premium of �571 on the website after entering the same details.###12###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
He said the practice is widespread across the industry and is �wholly unjustifiable�.###13###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
Doherty requested the Central Bank and the CCPC investigate the issue, with the Central Bank confirming last month that it is reviewing the concerns.###14###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
Today, the CCPC will state that it is also carrying out its own body of work.###15###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
Without pre-empting that work, O�Leary will tell committee members that he expects the review will result in a number of actions in 2020.###16###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
Switching providers.###18###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
�This will focus in particular on groups of consumers who may find it hard or impossible to switch providers,� he said.###19###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
Specifically in relation to insurance, the CCPC said it will engage with the Central Bank as their research and bank�s market study progresses.###20###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
It also plans to engage with national and European counterparts to share information and keep up to date with developments.###21###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
A public awareness campaign will be rolled out which will inform and provide information to consumers as to how they can switch service providers.###22###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
O�Leary says he is �acutely aware� that the committee is concerned about the issue of dual pricing.###23###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
O�Leary noted that two weeks ago a European Directive to modernise consumer law was adopted.###25###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
It aims to enhance transparency in online transactions, particular regarding the use of online reviews, personalised pricing based on algorithms or higher ranking of products due to paid placements.###26###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
Insurance Ireland will also appear before the committee today.###28###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
It is due to tell members that as a trade agency it does not hold the data of its members on pricing, and therefore will be limited in what information if can give.###29###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
In its opening statement today, it highlights that the Insurance Ireland has agreed fully engage with the Central Bank on its review of dual-pricing by the insurance industry in Ireland.###30###EN_254###[]###[]###[]
Bank of Estonia: Salary growth as strong as before crisis###1###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
Wage growth has reached pre-crisis levels, Bank of Estonia economist Orsolya Soosaar said on Friday.###2###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
released on Friday showed, in the second quarter of 2021, the average monthly gross wages and salaries were �1,538, which is 7.3 percent higher than the year before.###3###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
"""The increase in working hours per employee contributed to the acceleration of wage growth and wages grew faster in private companies than in the public sector."###4###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
"Taking into account seasonal factors, the average salary increased by 0.5 percent compared to the previous quarter,"" Soosaar said ."###5###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
She said salary growth would have been even faster if the share of employees by different fields of activity had remained the same as last year.###6###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
"""The recovery in the number of jobs in lower-than-average-wage activities, such as accommodation and food service activities, is somewhat holding back the increase in average wages,"" she said."###7###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
"""Economic growth has accelerated this year, but companies have recruited fewer employees than expected for this."###8###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
"Thus, labor productivity has increased, which provides an opportunity to raise wages,"" the economist said."###9###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
"The share of companies that perceive labor shortages as a significant problem also increased,"" she added."###11###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
Despite the larger number of jobseekers in the labor market, the perception of labor shortage increases wage pressure, Soosaar said.###12###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
Swedbank: Wage growth in Estonia fueled by labor shortages.###13###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
Swedbank senior economist Liis Elmik said a shortage of specialists is the reason behind accelerated wage growth in the second quarter.###14###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
"""The increase in the average salary corresponded exactly to Swedbank's forecast."###15###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
Wage growth accelerated from 5 percent in the first quarter to 7 percent in the second quarter.###16###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
"Wage growth picked up, as a year ago the average wage rose by only 1 percent, and without the wage compensation of the Unemployment Insurance Fund, the wage level would have fallen,"" Elmik said."###17###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
Elmik said the average gross salary has increased by 8 percent in two years.###18###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
While wages and salaries in accommodation, catering and trade were still 1-2 percent lower in the second quarter than two years ago, then 15-16 percent more was earned in IT and medicine than two years ago.###19###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
According to entrepreneurs, labor shortages are at pre-crisis levels in industry, services and construction.###21###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
Although unemployment is still relatively high, Elmik said that it is difficult for employers to find suitable specialists.###23###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
"""Left without work during the coronavirus crisis were many tourism and transport sector employees who cannot immediately become programmers, doctors or teachers,"" she added."###24###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
Swedbank estimates that the average gross salary will increase by 6 percent this year.###25###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
Next year, the average gross salary will rise slightly less, by more than 5 percent.###26###EN_262###[]###[]###[]
EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders published a message on Twitter on Wednesday in which he welcomed the agreement of the EU states.###2###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
The plan is to use the uniform vaccination pass this summer.###3###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
Also known as a �Green Pass�, this is intended to provide information on whether a person can spread the Coronavirus or at least how likely it is.###4###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
In addition to information about vaccinations, the certificate should also contain test results and information about a Coronavirus infection.###5###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
The issue of a uniform vaccination certificate was an important concern, especially for countries that are dependent on tourism, such as Greece, Spain and Cyprus.###7###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
Some of these countries had already worked out national solutions.###8###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
The agreement now proposed would oblige the national authorities to issue the said EU document to their citizens upon request.###9###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
However, the decision as to which restrictions will be lifted and whether the certificate allows further relief remains with the individual EU countries.###10###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
Nevertheless, the 27 states undertook to recognize the vaccination certificates of the other EU states.###11###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
According to the reports, the �Green Passport� should not be a requirement for travel within the EU, but merely help to facilitate border crossings.###12###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
What exactly this means is still unclear.###13###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
In addition, the vaccination card should only be used as long as the Corona crisis lasts.###14###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
The next step is to be approved by the EU Parliament so that the details can then be negotiated between the EU institutions.###16###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
Some MEPs still have concerns about data protection, in particular.###17###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
For Germany, it is planned that before the summer vacation people should be able to prove that they are completely vaccinated using a smartphone app.###18###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
This was announced on Wednesday from government circles, as the German Press Agency (dpa) reported.###19###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
The digital certificate is intended to give those affected the opportunity to quickly and forgery-proof provide evidence that they have been fully vaccinated and therefore regain certain basic rights again, for example when traveling on vacation.###20###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
The certificates should not be stored centrally on a server, but rather on the user�s smartphone.###21###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
In addition to the entry in the analogue yellow vaccination certificate, people who do not have a smartphone receive a printout of the digitally readable vaccination certificate as a QR code on paper.###22###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
Even if the smartphone is lost or changed, the certificate can be read into a smartphone again using the printed QR code.###23###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
The digital vaccination certificates are to be issued in the vaccination centers and at medical practices.###24###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
The German government is currently looking for a method by which people who have already been fully vaccinated can receive their certificate retrospectively.###25###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
The federal government is also discussing whether Corona infections that have been overcome should also be evaluated in the same way as complete vaccination protection but this may depend on research results.###26###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
As previously stated in the Official Journal of the European Union, the digital vaccination certificate will be created in Germany under the leadership of the American technology group IBM.###27###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
The Cologne start-up Ubirch, the Swabian IT service provider Bechtle and Govdigital, a cooperative association of ten IT service providers from the public sector, are also involved.###28###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
Similar to the official Corona warning app of the German government, the development of the system is to be programmed as an open source project and made transparent.###29###EN_265###[]###[]###[]
The vaccination certificate should then be stored either in the Corona warning app or a separate application programmed by IBM.###30###EN_265###[]###[]###[]

Government COVID-19 council opposes relaxing event capacity limits###1###EN_289###[]###[]###[]
The government's coronavirus scientific council (Valitsuse teadusn�ukoda) opposes lifting event capacity restrictions as proposed by culture minister T�nis Lukas (Isamaa) Friday.###2###EN_289###[]###[]###[]
The council was publicly backed by social affairs minister Tanel Kiik (Center) in this, continuing a tendency for the body � set up specifically to deal with the pandemic � to receive full government support, unlike the Health Board (Terviseamet), which has sometimes found itself at the receiving end of governmental criticism.###3###EN_289###[]###[]###[]

It�s being reported that ministers are also in agreement on the widening of Covid certificate use to include cinemas and theatres, but not gyms and hairdressers as predicted.###5###EN_293###[]###[]###[]
The proposals are being recommended in response to rising Covid-19 case numbers across the country in recent weeks.###8###EN_293###[]###[]###[]

We simply have to limit the increase we are experiencing at the moment,� Martin said.###12###EN_293###[]###[]###[]

NPHET said last week that the re-imposition of social and economic restrictions was not currently being recommended but �cannot fully be ruled out�.###16###EN_293###[]###[]###[]
It comes as the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 reached its highest level since February.###17###EN_293###[]###[]###[]

Comment on Factfind: Does the WHO 'not recommend' using rapid Covid tests in schools, as Norma Foley claimed?###1###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
Serial testing also took place at food-processing facilities, including meat plants, due to (among other things) the congregated nature of work in factories and the lifestyles of workers (who often shared accommodation and transport to and from work).###2###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
And serial testing was not just limited to workplaces: it was also introduced in Direct Provision centres � residential settings where people live in clusters � last autumn.###3###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
It is worth pointing out that in all of these settings, serial testing was introduced reactively, after large clusters often involving dozens of cases occurred in nursing homes, meat plants and Direct Provision centres.###4###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
Although a number of outbreaks have been linked to schools since they returned last August, none of these are currently active (because schools have been closed since before Christmas), meaning that a decision to introduce serial testing would now be proactive.###5###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
Asymptomatic cases.###6###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
The advice does warn that those who produce a negative result with an antigen test should be managed safely, and that the result �cannot completely exclude an active Covid-19 infection�.###9###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
It therefore suggests that if rapid testing occurs in this scenario, there should be repeat testing where possible along with the continued use of PCR-type tests to confirm cases, particularly among patients who show symptoms of Covid-19.###10###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
"However, there is a catch; the advice later suggests this should also occur when the ability of health services to carry out regular PCR testing is diminished."###11###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
It suggests that if this were to occur, antigen testing could be used if it was not possible to test all or any suspect cases of Covid-19 using PCR-type tests.###12###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
But the WHO also outlines a number of situations in which antigen tests should specifically not be used � including settings such as screening at points of entry at airports, for blood donation, and elective surgery.###13###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
Crucially, another scenario deemed inappropriate for antigen testing is in �individuals without symptoms unless the person is a contact of a confirmed case� of Covid-19.###14###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
The WHO suggests that where a person does not have symptoms of Covid-19 and has not been in contact with a confirmed case, the likelihood that they have Covid-19 � based on epidemiology, case contact, and clinical findings � is low.###15###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
Asked by TheJournal.ie to clarify her remarks following her claim on News at One on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Minister pointed to this part of the WHO�s advice.###16###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
�The current WHO advice on antigen testing is that it is �reasonable to use to investigate outbreaks�.###17###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
However, it is also advised that Ag-RDTs should not be used in routine surveillance testing where there are zero or only sporadic cases,� a statement said.###18###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
�Widespread community transmission� This is where things get complicated.###19###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
On the one hand, the WHO specifically does recommend the use of antigen tests in schools in some situations.###20###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
But this recommendation appears to be dependent on situations where PCR-type testing is no longer available because the testing system has become overburdened.###22###EN_295###[]###[]###[]
More than 100 ventilators available in Estonia as of October###1###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
ERR looked into how many breathing apparatuses Estonia has which could be used for COVID-19 patients in intensive care.###3###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
Tartu University Hospital has 66 devices, of which nearly two thirds are in daily use, according to the clinic's intensive care and anesthesiology department head Joel Starkopf.###4###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
"He explained: ""Breathing apparatuses are connected to beds, 80 percent of beds in intensive care are occupied, with planned but emergency patients."###5###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
All the patients there are not under ventilation necessarily, but staff are still occupied.###6###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
"And the bed."""###7###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
Tallinn's North Estonia Medical Center follows Tartu University Clinic as the second hospital in Estonia with a considerable number of ventilation devices, which is why there is an agreement that all patients in the Southern region, from Narva to Valga and for hospitals in J�rva County and Viljandi, will initially be directed to the Tartu University Hospital.###8###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
"Starkopf said: ""We are centralizing these infected people to the clinic, that is in its so-called first stage."###9###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
These are critical patients, whose treatment will last a long time, often two weeks.###12###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
It must also be taken into consideration that in some local hospitals, such as J�geva, do not have any ventilation devices.###14###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
Some, such as Valga, V�ru and Kuressaare hospitals, only have a few, with some already in use for heart attack and brain trauma patients.###15###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
P�rnu Hospital chairman Urmas Sule said the hospital has the capacity to take up to 20 patients needing ventilation in intensive care.###16###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
"""We have one isolator in a normal situation, which has the capability of isolating an infected patient for intensive care."###17###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
If we want to go a step forward and test our capabilities, we must create an entire wing.###18###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
"That would give us the capacity of adding six or seven beds,"" Sule said."###19###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
"The hospital chief continued: ""If the number of COVID-patients needing intensive care were to increase even more, we would be capable of providing 20 beds."###20###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
"But that would mean a dramatic hospital reorganization."""###21###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
By mid-October, the Health Board (Terviseamet) had mapped a total of 250 ventilation devices in the medicine database, with 80 percent being used daily.###22###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
That would leave 50 devices available for use by COVID-19 patients.###23###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
If the private sector's and the defense forces' appliances are added, there are more than 100 devices available.###24###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
The number of apparatuses will increase even more before the end of year, as 185 devices will be available.###25###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
Tartu University Hospital will also receive 25, P�rnu Hospital will get seven.###26###EN_301###[]###[]###[]
Starkopf said it is difficult to assess whether this will be enough, as noone can be sure how the epidemiological situation progresses.###27###EN_301###[]###[]###[]

Georgia Spending $5M for New Voting System as Lawmakers Debate More Restrictions###1###EN_343###[]###[]###[]
Georgia's Secretary of State Republican Brad Raffensperger is buying a new voting system worth $5 million despite debates about voting restrictions.###2###EN_343###[]###[]###[]
The new system will be bought using funding split between federal money and leftover bond funds Georgia borrowed to buy new voting machines, according to the Associated Press.###3###EN_343###[]###[]###[]
The current system being used is more than 10 years old, and the AP reported that during the first few days of in-person voting in the 2020 primary elections, it was blamed for slowdowns because the system could not access data fast enough to keep up with the large volume of voters.###5###EN_343###[]###[]###[]
This led to the debate of whether Raffensperger did enough to overturn President 's victory in Georgia in 2020.###6###EN_343###[]###[]###[]
Joe Biden The new system, called the Georgia Registration Voter Information System, is designed to allow officials to make reports more quickly and easily access data used at polling places to access voter information.###7###EN_343###[]###[]###[]
"""This new system is more advanced, more secure, and more user friendly and will give our election directors and my office new tools to better manage our election efforts,"" Raffensperger said to the Associated Press."###8###EN_343###[]###[]###[]
The current system will be online as backup with the plan to make redistricting changes in the system and then transfer the data into the new system.###9###EN_343###[]###[]###[]
Raffensperger said voters should see little to no change in their information.###10###EN_343###[]###[]###[]
According to WALB News, Raffensperger said county and local officials around Georgia have been introduced to the new system.###11###EN_343###[]###[]###[]
The officials will be trained in the coming weeks and months.###12###EN_343###[]###[]###[]

The purchase of the new system comes as lawmakers are still debating voter restrictions in Georgia.###16###EN_343###[]###[]###[]
According to the Georgia Recorde r , two Republican senators running for lieutenant governor of Georgia, and Raffensperger, have differing ideas of how voting should take place.###17###EN_343###[]###[]###[]
Senator Burt Jones, who is endorsed by former President Donald Trump , believes voting via touchscreen should be done away with and voting by paper should be the only way.###19###EN_343###[]###[]###[]
Jones believes electronic voting has the possibility of hacking and voting by paper is safer.###20###EN_343###[]###[]###[]
Senate President Pro Tempore Butch Miller believes the absentee voter drop box should be banned, as they are vulnerable to fraud, while Raffensperger believes there should be a constitutional amendment banning non-citizens from voting.###21###EN_343###[]###[]###[]

Donald Trump Should Declare Martial Law, Michael Flynn Retweeted from His Now-Banned Account###1###EN_348###[]###[]###[]
Trump had granted a full pardon to Michael Flynn, his first national security advisor, just eight days earlier.###2###EN_348###[]###[]###[]
And though his December 2 tweet was a retweet, and Flynn never explicitly mentioned martial law, behind the scenes the retired Army general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency pushed Trump campaign lawyers and the president himself to use the military to intervene in the results of the vote.###4###EN_348###[]###[]###[]
"Flynn, in a later Newsmax interview , said that Donald Trump had ""options"" to maintain the integrity of the election."###5###EN_348###[]###[]###[]
"It's not unprecedented,"" Flynn added."###9###EN_348###[]###[]###[]
According to the Department of Defense Inspector General's report on the Pentagon reaction to the elections and protests, Mr.###10###EN_348###[]###[]###[]
"Miller told us, ""There was absolutely no way ..."###11###EN_348###[]###[]###[]

He cited media stories alleging that the President's advisors were pushing him to declare martial law to invalidate the election and that Mr.###13###EN_348###[]###[]###[]
Constitution.###16###EN_348###[]###[]###[]
"In the Inspector General's report, Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy supports Miller's account, saying that Miller ""made it clear that the military would not be involved in certifying the election results and that '10 different news agencies' asked him about military use and martial law."""###19###EN_348###[]###[]###[]
He repeated others' calls and said he wasn't calling for it himself.###22###EN_348###[]###[]###[]

"But sedition cases are rare in modern America, the proof of ""overthrowing or destroying the government"" by force of violence a high bar."###25###EN_348###[]###[]###[]
Only 12 Americans have ever been successfully convicted in more than 200 yearsrarities like Aaron Burr and Jefferson Davis.###26###EN_348###[]###[]###[]
Most cases have been dismissed in court because judges have ruled that encouragement and incitement, no matter how radical, is protected by the First Amendment and doesn't prove that the accused had plans for a rebellion.###28###EN_348###[]###[]###[]

The Sarah Halimi affair: Killing the victim twice###1###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
The circumstances surrounding the murder, including the fact that Halimi was the only Jewish resident in her building, was further highlighted by the assailant shouting �Allahu Akbar� during the attack.###3###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
The murderer afterward even proclaimed �I killed the Shaitan�.###4###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
To the French Jewish community, this is the most poignant example of anti-Semitism in France.###5###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
But for several months the French government and media refused to label the killing as anti-Semitic, drawing criticism from Jewish public figures such as Alain Finkielkraut.###6###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
The government eventually acknowledged an anti-Semitic motivation for the killing, but in 2019 the assailant was declared to be not criminally responsible because he had consumed cannabis, which induced a state of psychosis.###7###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
The decision was appealed to the supreme Court of Cassation, who in 2021 upheld the lower court�s ruling.###8###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
In the case of Kobili Traor�, the psychiatrists were not unanimous.###9###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
While some claimed that acute delirium due to absorption of cannabis had made him act in an irresponsible way, others concluded that it had caused only a slight alteration in his behaviour.###10###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
Under these conditions, it was up to the court to decide, after an adversarial debate, whether he would be tried as a killer.###11###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
The African immigrant from Mali, reportedly became enraged following a family dispute and gained access to the neighbouring apartment of a different family, who immediately locked themselves into a bedroom, phoned police for help, and waited in fear as they listened to the intruder reciting verses from the Quran.###13###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
The police initially went to the wrong building while Traor� climbed a balcony from the apartment where the family was hiding, to the apartment of Halimi, the only Jewish resident of the building.###14###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
When police finally arrived at the apartment the intruder had entered first, they waited as more phone calls came in to the police emergency hotline reporting a woman screaming while a man was heard shouting �Allahu Akbar� and �I killed the Shaitan�.###15###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
After throwing Halimi from a third-floor window, Traor� returned to the first apartment where the family, still cowering behind a locked door, again heard him praying aloud to Allah.###16###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
Kobili Traor�, a drug dealer and drug addict, claimed insanity and was held in a psychiatric hospital, but one thing is certain: Traor� had a clear and coherent mind, during his so-called psychotic crisis, to unleash his murderous impulse on the only Jewish resident in the building.###17###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
A hundred days after the killing, the suspect was still under examination for voluntary homicide, and the aggravating factor of anti-Semitism had been dropped.###18###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
He sometimes went to the famous Omar mosque in rue Morand, �considered a temple of radical Islam�, and on the day of the murder he prayed there twice.###21###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
According to Jean-Alexandre Buchinger, an attorney for the victim�s family, the killer ought to have been charged with �murder with anti-Semitism as an aggravating circumstance�, but that French Jewish groups believed that this had not been done out of fear of encouraging support for Marine Le Pen and the National Rally�s election campaign.###23###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
In 2017, French writer Michel Onfray noted in a video about the silence surrounding the killing: �How can we kill this poor lady twice?###24###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
By not giving this information the echo that it deserved, it was to consider that the echo of this murder counted for nothing�.###25###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
He added that �whenever there is an escalation in terror, there is an escalation in the denial of terror.###26###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
Every reality today is ignored and swept away �if it is likely to play the game of the National Front�.###27###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
But reality always avenges itself one day�.###28###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
Following the final decision of the supreme Court of Cassation this month, President Macron called for the law to be changed .###29###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
Macron stated that France �does not judge citizens who are sick, we treat them� But deciding to take drugs and then �going crazy� should not, in my opinion, take away your criminal responsibility�.###30###EN_349###[]###[]###[]
Lawyers for Halimi�s family subsequently announced their intention to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights.###31###EN_349###[]###[]###[]

Yesterday, the British government announced that no immediate public inquiry would be held into the murder, despite calls from the Finucane family and the Irish government the UK to do so.###4###EN_379###[]###[]###[]
Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he was not taking a public inquiry off the table, but said further examinations of the case by police and a police watchdog should conclude first.###5###EN_379###[]###[]###[]
The 39-year-old solicitor, who represented both republican and loyalist paramilitaries during the Troubles, was shot dead in his family home in north Belfast in February 1989 by the Ulster Defence Association.###6###EN_379###[]###[]###[]
Speaking in the D�il today, the Taoiseach said it was �deeply, deeply disappointing� that British government has made the decision it had, adding that dealing with �legacy issues� from The Troubles has been �stop-start�.###8###EN_379###[]###[]###[]
He restated the Irish government�s position that a public inquiry was needed.###9###EN_379###[]###[]###[]
Finucane�s son John, a solicitor and Sinn Fein MP for north Belfast, has said Biden had previously voiced support for his family�s campaign.###11###EN_379###[]###[]###[]
�When he was then Senator Biden as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he supported our calls for an inquiry,� he told the BBC.###12###EN_379###[]###[]###[]
�I appreciate he�s going to be in arguably the busiest role on the planet, so we aren�t we aren�t blind to that, but President-elect Biden has already shown a clear interest in Irish affairs, he has history in supporting our campaign.###13###EN_379###[]###[]###[]
In the D�il today, the Taoiseach said US support would be relied upon.###14###EN_379###[]###[]###[]
�Collectively as an Oireachtas we can with one voice articulate to the British government again the view that a full public inquiry should be held,� Martin said.###15###EN_379###[]###[]###[]
Speaking earlier today, Pat Finucane�s widow Geraldine has described the British government�s decision as �despicable�.###16###EN_379###[]###[]###[]
Geraldine also accused British authorities of �arrogance� for ignoring a finding by the UK�s Supreme Court that all previous examinations of the killing had not been compliant with human rights standards.###17###EN_379###[]###[]###[]
Geraldine Finucane and the couple�s three children have been campaigning for decades for a public inquiry to establish the extent of security force involvement.###18###EN_379###[]###[]###[]
Despite the British government�s announcement yesterday, Geraldine said the Finucane family would note the decision and continue fighting on behalf of her husband.###19###EN_379###[]###[]###[]

Sunderland hire Phil Parkinson as new manager###1###EN_383###[]###[]###[]
The 51-year-old has been appointed the new Black Cats boss on a two-and-a-half-year deal following the departure of Jack Ross earlier this month.###3###EN_383###[]###[]###[]
This is a good squad of players, and I relish the challenge of working with them to achieve our goal of promotion from League One.�###7###EN_383###[]###[]###[]
They currently sit ninth in the third tier, their second season in the division following back-to-back relegations from the Premier League and the Sky Bet Championship.###10###EN_383###[]###[]###[]
Ross� team had lost only two games all season and reached the last 16 in the Carabao Cup, but sections of the fanbase were unhappy with the Scot�s style of play and team selections.###11###EN_383###[]###[]###[]
Jack Ross was unpopular with sections of the Sunderland fanbase (Adam Davy/PA) Chairman Stewart Donald said: �Phil has a proven track record when it comes to achieving promotion and I�m delighted to welcome him to Sunderland.###12###EN_383###[]###[]###[]
�During a rigorous recruitment process, it gradually became clear that he was the prime candidate to take the club forward.###13###EN_383###[]###[]###[]
His CV put him on our shortlist.###14###EN_383###[]###[]###[]
His references from within the game set him apart.###15###EN_383###[]###[]###[]

You�ll have a good idea of how McSharry must feel this week.###2###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
It�s one thing to possess the talent to make an Olympic final.###4###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
It�s a whole different thing actually making it happen.###5###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
Her journey into swimming happened by accident � literally.###6###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
There�s a reason it�s been 25 years since Ireland had an Olympic finalist in swimming.###10###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
It�s a very, very hard thing to achieve.###11###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
Back in 2017, I sat down with McSharry shortly after she won the World Junior title in the 100m backstroke, the 17-year-old taking me through the routine that brought her to that point.###13###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
At the time she was preparing for her Leaving Cert at Col�iste Cholmcille, the time demands of swimming forcing her to jettison a seventh subject, aware that every hour was too precious to spend any of on something that might not produce a result.###14###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
She would be out the door by 5am on every school morning, lie-ins not something McSharry could entertain if she wanted to get where she was going.###15###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
�You have to have that determination and drive,� she said.###16###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
Her parents would taxi her on the half-hour drive to the pool, where she�d warm up for a half hour then spend the next two hours going back and forth across her 25-metre lane.###17###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
�But you have to deal with it and grow stronger.�###19###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
She�d be back there every evening, and nights were spent catching up on homework before bedtime at no later than 10pm.###20###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
�Maybe once or twice a year.###23###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
If I do it�ll just tire me for the rest of the week.�###24###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
To get to the top of her chosen sport necessitated tough decisions, and one came in 2019 when McSharry committed to enrol at the University of Tennessee, where coach Matt Kredich has since guided her career.###25###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
In her 100m breaststroke heat in Tokyo on Sunday she breezed into the semis with 1:06.39, then came back out on Monday morning to finish fourth in her semi-final, her 1:06.59 seeing her through.###28###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
It capped a remarkable rise into to the elite echelon of her sport, and seeing her achieve it and speak about what it meant � a hint of American twang now in her accent � brought back memories of that conversation in 2017.###29###EN_388###[]###[]###[]
McSharry didn�t know Murphy but knew of her story and she was under no illusions about the breadth of the divide she had to cross.###31###EN_388###[]###[]###[]

Can the brain effectively combine natural and artificial vision?###1###FR_041###[]###[]###[]
Macular degeneration (AMD) causes blindness in millions of people in the Western world.###2###FR_041###[]###[]###[]
It is the most common cause of severe vision loss in people aged 50 and over, and its prevalence increases with age.###3###FR_041###[]###[]###[]
"Until now, neurobiologists didn't know whether the brain could effectively combine natural and artificial vision; a new study has answered this question in the affirmative."###5###FR_041###[]###[]###[]
Located inside the eye, the retina contains light receptors (photoreceptors) that absorb light.###6###FR_041###[]###[]###[]
The information is then processed and transmitted to the brain.###7###FR_041###[]###[]###[]
The macula, the central area of the retina, processes most of the information reaching the brain from the eyes, enabling vision during reading and driving, facial recognition and any other activity requiring precise vision.###8###FR_041###[]###[]###[]
In the peripheral retina, the area outside the macula that primarily aids spatial judgment, vision is 10 to 20 times less precise.###9###FR_041###[]###[]###[]
In AMD, precise vision is impaired by damage to the center of the retina, while peripheral vision remains normal.###10###FR_041###[]###[]###[]
Brain: can effectively combine natural and artificial vision.###11###FR_041###[]###[]###[]
When there is damage to the photoreceptor layers of the retina, an artificial retina - a device constructed from tiny electrodes smaller than the width of a human hair - can be implanted.###12###FR_041###[]###[]###[]
Activation of these electrodes results in electrical stimulation of the remaining retinal cells, enabling visual restoration, albeit only partially.###13###FR_041###[]###[]###[]
AMD patients implanted with an artificial retina have a combination of artificial central vision and normal peripheral vision.###14###FR_041###[]###[]###[]
In this respect, one of the crucial questions is whether the brain can properly integrate artificial and natural vision.###16###FR_041###[]###[]###[]

"We used a unique projection system that stimulated natural vision, artificial vision or a combination of natural and artificial vision, while simultaneously recording cortical responses in rodents implanted with a subretinal implant,"" says Tamar Arens-Arad."###19###FR_041###[]###[]###[]

Oumuamua: is the hypothesis of its artificial origin really plausible?###1###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
For astronomers and astrophysicists, the law of gravity should always be the dominant factor when a large-scale object evolves in the Solar System.###2###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
The Sun's gravitational attraction has by far the greatest effect, drawing all mass towards it in accordance with Newton's or Einstein's laws.###3###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
According to Newton's law of gravitation, the only possible orbits should be a circle, ellipse, parabola or hyperbola.###4###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
For an object like 'Oumuamua, the orbit must be hyperbolic.###5###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
"An object originating in our Solar System, from Neptune or beyond, could initially move at speeds of up to 1 km/s; 'Oumuamua began its entry into the Solar System at speeds in excess of 20 km/s."###6###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
Without passing close to gas giants to benefit from a gravitational slingshot effect, the object is necessarily of interstellar origin.###7###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
The only problem with this scenario is that the very detailed observations of Oumuamua showed no outgassing phenomena or tail-like structures.###8###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
In addition to the unusual acceleration, the only remarkable property to emerge from the observations is the object's smooth, elongated shape.###9###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
The unequal heating mechanism is extremely interesting.###10###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
When one side of an interstellar object faces the Sun, it heats up to temperatures that can be several hundred degrees higher than those on the opposite side, resulting in a significant temperature gradient.###11###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
Every object gives off energy in proportion to its temperature.###12###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
The warm side then radiates more energy than the cold side.###13###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
The irregular nature of the asteroid implies uneven radiation emission, which could, in principle, lead to abnormal acceleration.###14###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
The acceleration calculations carried out in the context of this hypothesis have yet to be compared with the measurements made.###15###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
The ultimate explanation is solar radiation pressure.###16###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
"This phenomenon is due to the transfer of the photon impulse onto a given surface; in other words, the flow of photons impinging on a surface causes the latter to move, applying a constant pressure."###17###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
If 'Oumuamua has a large enough planar surface, coupled with relatively low mass, then solar radiative pressure could be responsible for its excess acceleration.###18###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
This is the hypothesis developed by Baily and Loeb.###19###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
By performing relatively simple calculations, the two astrophysicists showed that for an object with a particular mass/surface ratio, then the acceleration measured would correspond to that provided by solar radiation pressure.###20###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
The authors could have stopped their development here and provided a perfectly plausible scientific explanation.###21###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
Oumumua: an implausible artificial origin.###22###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
Nevertheless, Baily and Loeb, while pointing out that such an object could be of natural origin, went on to introduce the hypothesis of an artificial origin as well, making direct reference to a spacecraft developed by an extraterrestrial civilization.###23###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
It would thus use the solar sail principle, based on the radiative pressure phenomenon described above, to move around.###24###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
Indeed, in their calculations, the authors show that in order to exhibit such a high acceleration as a function of the solar radiative pressure received, the structure would have to be between 0.3 and 0.9 mm thick.###25###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
They point out that although extremely thin, such an object could survive interstellar travel on galactic scales, while resisting collisions with dust and gas, as well as rotational and tidal forces.###26###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
They conclude their hypothesis by pointing out that if this structure is of natural origin, then it is necessarily composed of a material that is currently unknown in terms of the physical properties involved.###27###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
There are several natural explanations for the observations and data collected that do not require the involvement of new physics, exotic scenarios or the intervention of extraterrestrial intelligence.###29###FR_043###[]###[]###[]
Especially since the asteroid's spectral signature, color, reflectivity and a whole host of other properties are entirely consistent with a natural origin.###30###FR_043###[]###[]###[]

S'entend, pour la France.###3###FR_157###[]###[]###[]
It's hard to say, given the avalanche of figures quoted here and there.###4###FR_157###[]###[]###[]
Echoing a study by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, or , on February 10, put the figure at 7.4 billion euros.###5###FR_157###[]###[]###[]
By way of comparison, the budget of the Ministry of Justice will be 9.57 billion in 2023, and that of the Armed Forces 43.9 billion.###6###FR_157###[]###[]###[]
You can put whatever you like on the figures, but it means that aid to Ukraine represents 17% of France's own defense spending.###7###FR_157###[]###[]###[]
That's no mean feat.###8###FR_157###[]###[]###[]
In addition, we need to take into account the European Union's aid to the EU in 2022: 35 billion (again, figures from the Kiel Institute).###9###FR_157###[]###[]###[]
However, in 2022, France paid 26.35 billion euros to the European Union (including 24.586 billion under the Finance Act passed in December using the 49.3 calibre, the latest barrel to come out of the Borne factories).###10###FR_157###[]###[]###[]
It's true that, in return, France has received and is receiving several billion euros from Europe, but it pays more to the EU than it receives: in those billions paid by the EU to Ukraine, there are bound to be French euros!###11###FR_157###[]###[]###[]
So 7.4 billion today.###12###FR_157###[]###[]###[]

It's worth noting that in a country where, in 2001, the legislator instituted an organic law on finance laws (LOLF), with the virtuous objective of establishing genuine management control over state public spending, in a logic of performance and transparency, we (i.e. Parliament, i.e. citizens) would be entitled to have an exact assessment of what this war has cost, is costing and will cost France's budget.###18###FR_157###[]###[]###[]

"How the French ""alt-right"" is appropriating the codes of TikTok, Instagram and YouTube"###1###FR_218###[]###[]###[]

RESTORING THE EXCELLENCE OF FRENCH SCHOOLS.###1###FR_M_032###[]###[]###[]
Numerous international studies underline the fact that, over the last thirty years, the level of French pupils has plummeted in mathematics, reading and written expression.###3###FR_M_032###[]###[]###[]
The result is that almost 100,000 students leave the school system each year without any qualifications whatsoever.###5###FR_M_032###[]###[]###[]
This situation is no accident.###6###FR_M_032###[]###[]###[]
"It stems from an ideology, implemented with the ""coll�ge unique"" in 1977."###7###FR_M_032###[]###[]###[]
It is exacerbated by an allocation of financial resources that defies common sense.###8###FR_M_032###[]###[]###[]
Our country devotes far too few resources to primary education, and compensates for this lack of investment by allocating very large sums to secondary education as a result of the massification of access to coll�ge.###9###FR_M_032###[]###[]###[]
First and foremost, French, mathematics and history will be given priority at primary level, with the number of teaching hours significantly increased (since 1966, the number of teaching hours has fallen by 20%).###10###FR_M_032###[]###[]###[]
The government's limited measure of doubling the number of pupils in the lower grades will be extended to twenty in primary and thirty in secondary schools.###11###FR_M_032###[]###[]###[]
In the first instance, this will undoubtedly mean recruiting more primary school teachers.###12###FR_M_032###[]###[]###[]
In the medium term, this effort will be offset by the reduction in secondary school enrolments required as a result of the abolition of the single coll�ge and the promotion of vocational courses.###13###FR_M_032###[]###[]###[]
Transferring the bulk of the effort to primary schools is also a moral obligation, given the objectives of the far-reaching reform I'm calling for.###14###FR_M_032###[]###[]###[]
At the end of these three years, 80% of young people go on to vocational training by the age of 14.###18###FR_M_032###[]###[]###[]
As for the best students who have passed through vocational training, they are offered the chance to enter higher education if they wish, depending on the quality of their results.###20###FR_M_032###[]###[]###[]
"Such a model should lead us to abandon the totally outdated objective of ""80% of an age group taking the baccalaureate"", and replace it with two objectives: 40% of young people in vocational training by the end of 3rd grade; and a match between training policies and the forecast needs of the economy."###21###FR_M_032###[]###[]###[]
As I see it, the vocational stream is not just one that prepares students for manual jobs.###22###FR_M_032###[]###[]###[]

"Pm ""pardoning"" Casarini & Co. but investigating the Yellow Flames"###1###IT_049###[]###[]###[]
In fact, investigators, as revealed by Il Fatto Quotidiano , may set their eyes on the work of the Guardia di Finanza .###2###IT_049###[]###[]###[]
The Mare Jonio case, as it is known, arose last March, almost a year ago.###4###IT_049###[]###[]###[]
After a relatively quiet period on the immigration front, a new NGO ship with 49 migrants on board has reappeared off Lampedusa.###5###IT_049###[]###[]###[]
The vessel was indeed the Mare Jonio, belonging to the Italian NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans.###6###IT_049###[]###[]###[]
Then, as previously written in the past few hours, magistrates of the Sicilian prosecutor's office requested that the case be closed precisely against the two suspects.###10###IT_049###[]###[]###[]
According to investigators, therefore, Casarini and Marrone are not prosecutable for the crimes for which they were charged, namely aiding and abetting illegal immigration and failing to comply with an order given by a military vessel.###11###IT_049###[]###[]###[]
Indeed, as mentioned earlier, magistrates in Agrigento may open a file on the order given by the Guardia di Finanza.###12###IT_049###[]###[]###[]
In particular, what caught the attention of investigators was a part of the wiretaps related to the dialogue between crew of the Mare Jonio and the patrol boat Apruzzi of the Yellow Flames.###13###IT_049###[]###[]###[]
With financiers who, at this point, could themselves become suspects after Casarini and Marrone's request for dismissal.###17###IT_049###[]###[]###[]
Also because, according to rumors also reported in Il Fatto Quotidiano, according to Sicilian magistrates at that specific time there were no alternative routes to landing in Italy.###18###IT_049###[]###[]###[]
In fact, among the reasons that led the Agrigento prosecutor's office to request that the two from Mediterranea be dismissed was that it was impossible to take the migrants to Libya , as it was not considered a safe port, as well as Tunisia , since the latter country does not have a Sar zone.###19###IT_049###[]###[]###[]

Omicron 5, Ema: okay for Pfizer vaccine in fall (but doses will arrive in November).###1###IT_214###[]###[]###[]
What do we know###2###IT_214###[]###[]###[]
In Europe, the Omicron 5 subvariant is now dominant, while the much-feared Centaurus (more correctly Omicron Ba.2.75) is not spreading, at least for now, proving to have more luck in media headlines (fascinated by the nickname Centaurus invented by a Twitter user) than in real life.###6###IT_214###[]###[]###[]
"Explains to AdnKronos Salute, Mauro Pistello, director of the virology unit at the University Hospital of Pisa and vice president of the Italian Society of Microbiology: The prevalence of Omicron subvariant BA.5 is over 80 percent; BA.4 comes in around 7 and BA.2 has virtually disappeared, around 2."###7###IT_214###[]###[]###[]
The new subvariant BA.2.75, renamed Centaurus, does not break through: it is there, but remains confined to a few cases.###8###IT_214###[]###[]###[]
We then recorded two very different subvariants of BA.5, which are at 5 percent: one, BE.1, we had also seen 2 weeks ago and we notice that it is showing up.###9###IT_214###[]###[]###[]
At this point I think it is difficult for Centaurus to establish itself.###10###IT_214###[]###[]###[]
This is at least the current situation.###11###IT_214###[]###[]###[]
Pfizer-Biontech have already applied to Ema for approval of a bivalent Covid vaccine, which also covers Omicron, but in its initial version, Omicron 1.###14###IT_214###[]###[]###[]
Given the prevalence of 5, even in light of a request from the Fda (the U.S. drug agency), however, further adaptation is being worked on.###15###IT_214###[]###[]###[]
Moderna's path is similar: the European Commission has signed an agreement that shifts delivery of new supplies from summer to fall-winter, and, Brussels explains, the understanding also covers vaccines adapted to the new BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron variants, which are awaiting Ema approval.###17###IT_214###[]###[]###[]

"Liquid biopsy, through the analysis of a simple sample of the patient's blood, allows us to derive valuable information about the tumor and its development by ""hunting"" for the molecular traces released by circulating tumor cells in the bloodstream or DNA: laboratory analysis of these traces can detect, for example, the presence of specific alterations in the tumor's DNA that may affect the tumor's sensitivity or rather resistance to different therapeutic treatments."###14###IT_219###[]###[]###[]

Bank of America announces hyperinflation###1###NL_009###[]###[]###[]
I've been amazed for years that most people seem to think it's normal for central banks to keep creating unimaginable amounts of money out of thin air with the push of a button, time and time again, so that governments can keep spending tons of money, thinking that at the same time their purchasing power can be maintained.###2###NL_009###[]###[]###[]
Now it is almost here: noted Bank of America is literally announcing HYPERinflation.###4###NL_009###[]###[]###[]
Based on the annual figures, the number of U.S. companies reporting (high) inflation increased by nearly 800%.###6###NL_009###[]###[]###[]
"Bank of America therefore cannot help but note that this ""at the very least indicates that 'temporary' hyperinflation is coming."###7###NL_009###[]###[]###[]
Commodities (+28%), consumer prices (+36%), transportation (+35%) and manufactured goods are particularly at risk of exploding in price.###8###NL_009###[]###[]###[]
"While the BoA thinks it will still be ""manageable,"" hyperinflation is precisely a process that inherently proves that something is whooping OUT of control. (1) Towering prices."###9###NL_009###[]###[]###[]
Actually, we see this hidden high inflation already present in sky-high housing prices (after all, these are not associated with a strong economic recovery, but with a government-financed debt economy).###11###NL_009###[]###[]###[]

Some 250 Noa are said to still be walking around in the Netherlands.###3###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
I do not believe in this solution.###5###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
So should we specialize even further?###7###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
In my opinion, it is not about expertise or specialization, but a change in attitude.###8###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
The latter I would like to explain in this contribution.###9###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
What would have been the right approach for Noa?###10###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
I cannot answer that question directly, especially since I only have the information that was obtained through the media.###11###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
I only want to indicate here what can be recommended based on my clinical experience.###12###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
I have twice been director of a closed institution for severely behaviorally disturbed girls.###13###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
Then for more than thirty years I led projects where boys and girls with the same severe disorders were treated intensively but at home.###14###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
More than half of the girls had experienced incest, rape or molestation.###15###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
Automutilation and suicide attempts were frequent.###16###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
Over the years, I gained insight into what works and what doesn't work with this very difficult group of adolescents.###17###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
Scientific research always accompanied the treatments.###18###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
On this basis, I would like to make the following recommendations, with due trepidation.###19###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
It is not about treating an eating disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.###20###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
The issue is Noa's treatment.###21###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
What is meant by this?###22###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
Noa was much more than her disorders.###23###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
She will certainly have had many talents and good qualities as well.###24###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
In addition, she faced many problems, which she hid from those around her for years.###25###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
Until she was 11, Noa was doing well.###26###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
So she had a nice childhood with her parents.###27###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
Her parents could be proud of that and Noa could make good memories.###28###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
This should have been a major theme in conversations with the parents and with the girl.###29###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
This is how we get these people out of the atmosphere of all misery and failure.###30###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
Perhaps that is exactly what social workers have neglected.###31###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
I usually did not do that myself, but for this purpose sought out one of my young assistants with whom it clicked well between a patient and her.###33###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
That employee then received the necessary guidance and advice from the team.###34###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
"In fact, based on countless experiences, I would venture to say that a young trainee who is highly motivated and all about her ""client"" can achieve better results that the most experienced specialist."###35###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
After all, everything is about the supportive relationship, especially with mental health complaints and disorders.###36###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
"Second, the treatment of should not focus on the ""client"" alone."###37###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
"Treatment aimed at the individual always carries the message that the person is ""sick"" or ""disturbed,"" which can easily be coupled with a great but unjustified sense of guilt or with tremendously low self-esteem."###38###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
Noa had a father and a mother, a brother and a sister.###39###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
By this I do not mean that all family members should have been treated.###40###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
The parents, her brother and sister were with Noa for hours every day.###41###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
The social worker at most a few hours a week.###42###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
On the Internet, I saw an interview with Noa's parents.###44###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
They seemed like motivated parents to me, who unfortunately suffered greatly from what happened to their daughter over all these years.###45###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
Regular and frequent home visits can work wonders here.###47###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
The solution does not lie in establishing yet another, expensive over-specialized institution.###50###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
With the latter, waiting lists never develop.###52###NL_025###[]###[]###[]
People who are suffering greatly psychologically especially need someone who can listen, really cares about them and gives them a warm heart.###53###NL_025###[]###[]###[]

Background: the battle for automotive data###2###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
Have you ever considered that most modern cars capture all kinds of data?###3###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
Cars that are connected can even send that data.###4###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
Travel dates thus.###8###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
That's all the data generated when you move from A to B.###9###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
"That can be by car or by public transportation, but we focus on the ""travel data"" produced when you drive a car."###10###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
With all the electronic safety systems and information technology used, you could say a car is something like a brain.###11###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
That brain tracks exactly what the car is doing and also records where the car is and at what time.###12###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
All that information can be traced back to your car's license plate and VIN number, and therefore it is personal information.###13###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
Moreover, your car also records information that is about you personally, such as your driving style.###14###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
The various systems in your car are all linked together, so the brain in your car not only perceives that you are driving 100 km/h, it also sees (thanks to traffic sign recognition) that you are doing so on an 80 km/h road in the dark (lights are on), while it is raining (windshield wipers are on).###15###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
Moreover, in many cases, your car connects with your smartphone or tablet and can communicate with its surroundings, such as other cars or roadside systems.###16###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
If you were to combine all that data endlessly, it would create a mountain of data about you and your car.###17###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
Cars that are connected thus send their data periodically.###18###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
"""That usually ends up in a server at the car manufacturer's premises and they decide what happens to that data, who is allowed to use it and under what conditions,"" explained Leo Bingen, Smart Mobility & ITS consultant at the RAI Association."###19###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
"This discussion is still ongoing."""###21###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
It should be a stand-alone contract.###23###NL_028###[]###[]###[]
Not only with new cars, but also when buying a used car, you as a consumer should again be able to decide where the data from your car goes.###24###NL_028###[]###[]###[]

Reportage Party Congress CDA Nitrogen?###1###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
In both cases, it remained an idea.###7###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
Now the CDA is trying again.###8###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
In Amersfoort, where CDA members gathered this Saturday for an election congress kicking off the campaign for the Provincial Council and Water Board elections, CDA leader Wopke Hoekstra made a plea for the reintroduction of active military service.###9###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
That was suspended more than a quarter century ago in the Netherlands.###10###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
The CDA wants to reverse that.###11###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
That there is no majority for the plan in the House of Representatives, the Christian Democrats also know.###14###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
But the idea fits a story that the CDA has been eager to tell again for some time, and thus in the campaign.###15###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
"In Amersfoort, the words ""together"" and ""connection"" fell above average."###17###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
Community Fund.###19###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
Among other things, the group came up with the idea of creating a community fund to finance facilities such as community centers or swimming pools.###21###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
It is no coincidence that the CDA wants to appropriate that issue.###22###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
First, Christian Democrats are feeling the pressure from Caroline van der Plas's BoerBurgerBeweging, which is very much focused on non-urban areas.###23###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
The two parties are making opposite moves in the polls: BBB is on a gain, the CDA on a loss.###24###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
But the fact that the CDA again emphatically starts talking about community spirit and the region also has to do with something more fundamental than electoral competition.###25###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
Following the electoral defeat in the 2021 House of Representatives elections, the party asked former president of the Scientific Institute Richard van Zwol to consider the party's recognizability.###26###NL_075###[]###[]###[]

One: connecting differences.###29###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
But in the years that followed, it disappeared more and more into the background.###31###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
Known views.###33###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
On the latter topic, Wopke Hoekstra also spoke Saturday.###34###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
"""The current numbers are simply not sustainable,"" he said."###35###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
What was striking is that Hoekstra almost didn't mention the issue that resonates so strongly with CDA supporters: the nitrogen issue.###37###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
In summer###38###NL_075###[]###[]###[]
, after that he wouldn't say anything about it.###39###NL_075###[]###[]###[]

Opinion Jonas De Raeve Do we finally dare to look beyond the teaching certificate?###1###NL_101###[]###[]###[]
A professional qualification should be worth as much in the labor market as an educational diploma.###4###NL_101###[]###[]###[]
It is an important step toward competency-based thinking and much needed in a rapidly changing job market.###6###NL_101###[]###[]###[]
But the potential of professional qualifications is much greater than we can estimate today.###7###NL_101###[]###[]###[]
The coalition agreement already offers opportunities with the lifelong learning platform.###10###NL_101###[]###[]###[]
Education will also have to embrace professional qualifications.###13###NL_101###[]###[]###[]
However, vocational qualifications offer many opportunities to better match technical and labor market-oriented training to labor market needs in secondary education and to provide more flexible lifelong learning offerings in higher education.###15###NL_101###[]###[]###[]
Thus, we can finally reduce the unqualified outflow.###17###NL_101###[]###[]###[]
Perhaps recognizing professional qualifications could even be part of the solution to the teacher shortage?###18###NL_101###[]###[]###[]
Employers have created hundreds of professional qualifications in recent years.###20###NL_101###[]###[]###[]
For nearly 500 occupations, they created a detailed list of required knowledge and skills needed to perform the job.###21###NL_101###[]###[]###[]
Now it is time for this time investment to begin to pay off and for the qualifications to find their way into the job market.###22###NL_101###[]###[]###[]
Employers can also do their part by recognizing the importance of professional qualifications in hiring and performance reviews.###23###NL_101###[]###[]###[]
A strong awareness campaign with concrete examples should support this.###25###NL_101###[]###[]###[]

Consumer & Corona When will the bank defer my mortgage payments?###1###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
This section addresses corona-related consumer law questions about work, finance and leisure.###2###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
The issue.###3###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
Making mortgage repayments was unnecessary for now, and interest payments were suspended, banks reported in mid-March.###5###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
"""Banks are now part of the solution, not the problem,"" ABN Amro chief Kees van Dijkhuizen outlined the setup, citing the 2008 financial crisis."###6###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
What exactly does this payment break look like?###7###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
And to whom does it apply?###8###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
Here's how it is.###9###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
The answer to that question depends on the mortgage lender.###10###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
"Almost all have now rigged ""corona schemes"" for customers in financial trouble: from ABN Amro, ING and Rabobank to insurers like Aegon and new players like Munt Hypotheken and Florius."###11###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
The payment break at ABN Amro, for example, applies by default for three months and (because of the rush due to the number of applications) may not take effect until June 1.###14###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
"ING, on the other hand, immediately suspends mortgage payments and uses ""a term by mutual agreement,"" instead of three months."###15###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
Approaches to making up for missed mortgage payments also differ among mortgage lenders.###16###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
"At ABN Amro, the three missed months of interest and redemption are spread out over the period to Dec. 31, 2021, while Rabobank merely states, ""we'll make arrangements about that later."""###17###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
The three largest banks do not charge additional fees for the missed months, they say.###18###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
Mortgage payments must still be paid, but there is no additional cost to take advantage of the scheme.###19###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
"Thus, the ""late payment interest,"" which is normally charged when a mortgagee falls behind on repayment, does not apply."###20###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
The contrast with Belgium, which also has a pay break, is considerable.###21###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
The Belgian pause came about after consultations between the central bank, the finance ministry and the banking umbrella.###22###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
As a result, a uniform maximum six-month payment break will apply to consumers who have no more than 25,000 euros in their savings accounts.###23###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
ABN Amro, Rabobank and ING have no such financial buffer limit, they said when asked.###24###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
"ING stresses that customers should contact it and ""not wait until their buffer is completely gone."""###25###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
"ABN Amro says it is discussing with customers ""whether a payment break is the best solution."""###26###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
"""If there is (a lot of) savings present, it is obvious that the customer will use it first."""###27###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
"Dutch banks' criteria ""are rather vague,"" notes attorney Thomas van Vugt of AMS Lawyers."###28###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
Above all, the key question remains unclear: when are your financial problems serious enough to qualify for the break?###29###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
Van Vugt points out that although the payment break is a gesture by the bank, this does not mean that the bank may use it arbitrarily.###30###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
The banks decided to make the offer, and that brings with it certain responsibilities and a duty of care.###31###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
"""If people substantiate that they have financial problems or foresee them as a result of the coronavirus, then as a bank you cannot simply say that someone is not entitled to the payment break."###32###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
"When in doubt, the decision should be in favor of the customer."""###33###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
The answer.###34###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
Because each mortgage lender has designed its own corona scheme, there is no uniform rule for who gets a payment break on their mortgage and for how long it applies.###35###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
The pay break is a gesture and not a right.###36###NL_102###[]###[]###[]
Nevertheless, mortgage lenders - now that they offer the breaks - may not simply refuse them if customers plausibly demonstrate that they have financial corona problems.###37###NL_102###[]###[]###[]

Need for European solidarity more than ever###1###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
The global shock of the corona pandemic affects all European countries.###2###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
Europe is experiencing its worst health crisis since the Spanish flu.###3###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
Once the health crisis is under control, we must prepare for economic recovery.###7###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
Fiscal measures are estimated to average 2.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2020.###10###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
Programs to support liquidity through government guarantees and tax deferrals for businesses and individuals exceed 13 percent of GDP.###11###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
Complementing those national measures requires a coordinated approach at the European level.###12###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
"The European Commission has relaxed state aid rules and, together with the European Council, activated the ""escape clause"" of the budget rules, allowing countries to increase budget spending."###13###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
The question is what else is possible now and in the near future at the European level.###15###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
How can Europe quickly mobilize additional funding to support governments, businesses and citizens in all EU member states?###16###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
In the short term and at least before 2020, European solidarity must be shaped by the rapid use of existing European institutions - the Commission, the Investment Bank (EIB) and the Stability Mechanism (ESM) - and the instruments at their disposal.###17###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
In addition, the 37 billion euros from the Corona Response Investment Initiative will be used to support health care, SMEs and the labor market.###19###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
The European Investment Bank proposes a pan-European guarantee fund.###20###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
In it, �25 billion worth of guarantees would come from member states, which could then be leveraged to mobilize an additional �200 billion for SMEs, midcaps and companies in the real economy.###21###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
The European Emergency Fund ESM has 410 billion euros of ammunition and can provide credit at low interest rates.###22###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
Currently, the so-called precautionary lines of credit - never before deployed - seem most appropriate.###24###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
Such credits offer the advantage that money can flow quickly if a country needs urgent support because the facility is already in position.###25###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
If the Investment Bank and the ESM push the gas pedal further, they will have to issue bonds to finance their lending.###26###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
The Investment Bank - and to a lesser extent the Commission - issue such debt for all 27 member states, and the ESM emergency fund for the 19 eurozone countries.###27###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
Those three institutions have been issuing so-called mutualized debt securities, i.e. European debt, for years.###28###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
Today they have about 800 billion euros of debt outstanding.###29###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
All three provide financing at interest rates well below the financing cost of most member states.###30###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
They have also proven to be efficient and successful even in the face of substantial economic headwinds.###31###NL_103###[]###[]###[]

At the beginning of the euro crisis, the first temporary bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, took seven months to issue its first bond.###35###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
And that was already one with a rocky pace compared to similar institutions, which took three years.###36###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
Creating new European debt requires capital, guarantees or allocated revenues, as well as a well-functioning legal and governance system.###37###NL_103###[]###[]###[]
Therefore, it is best to use all the existing institutions and instruments that have been successfully mobilizing large sums for years.###38###NL_103###[]###[]###[]

British newspapers on Harry and Meghan's 'Megxit':###1###NL_106###[]###[]###[]
2019 was a tumultuous year for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.###5###NL_106###[]###[]###[]
They became the parents of Archie, a hefty boy now eight months old, and were frequently the subject of stories in the tabloid press after his birth.###6###NL_106###[]###[]###[]

Wednesday's announcement, that Harry and Meghan are stepping down from the British royal family , certainly has to do with those events of the past year, according to insiders.###10###NL_106###[]###[]###[]
"Yet the newspapers and public broadcaster BBC mainly focus on the fact that the ""Megxit"" announcement was made without first informing their relatives."###11###NL_106###[]###[]###[]

As the world's most important auto show was canceled due to the encroaching corona virus, Daimler CEO Ola K�llenius addressed the press in a teleconference on Tuesday.###3###NL_111###[]###[]###[]
Although more and more carmakers are staying away from expensive saloons, the successor to legendary Mercedes executive Dieter Zetsche swears allegiance to the concept.###4###NL_111###[]###[]###[]
K�llenius (50) has his hands full with the coronavirus.###6###NL_111###[]###[]###[]
In the European plants, the virus is not causing any problems for the time being, according to the CEO.###8###NL_111###[]###[]###[]
'Our supply chain is global.###9###NL_111###[]###[]###[]

Daimler's auto branch saw its ebitda halve to 3.4 billion euros last year.###19###NL_111###[]###[]###[]
"K�llenius attributes that decline mainly to ""issues from the past."###20###NL_111###[]###[]###[]

Euh, it's not wise to talk about details when we're still talking to governments.###25###NL_111###[]###[]###[]
Daimler is also chasing in the electric field.###26###NL_111###[]###[]###[]
Daimler is mainly counting on Smart for electrification.###28###NL_111###[]###[]###[]
Mercedes is now positioning the city car, which never really made a profit, as an all-electric brand.###29###NL_111###[]###[]###[]
Before that, K�llenius parked Smart in a joint venture with Chinese group Geely.###30###NL_111###[]###[]###[]
Li Shufu, the owner of Geely, recently became a major shareholder in Daimler and he owns Volvo.###31###NL_111###[]###[]###[]
About synergies with the Swedish premium brand, Daimler's Swedish CEO remains on the record.###32###NL_111###[]###[]###[]
That could lead to greater opportunities.###35###NL_111###[]###[]###[]
I can't say anything concrete about that today, but we are open to the possibilities.###36###NL_111###[]###[]###[]
We are within shooting distance, although everything depends on sales.###39###NL_111###[]###[]###[]

At the local level, Flemish mayors also seem to have ears for the proposal.###16###NL_122###[]###[]###[]
"And Aalsters Mayor Christoph D'Haese (N-VA) also called the ideas of the French-speaking scientists ""a constructive approach because we really do have to start looking at this health crisis in a different way."""###18###NL_122###[]###[]###[]

"""Where do you draw the line?"""###20###NL_122###[]###[]###[]
However, among the Belgian Beauty Federation and United Hairdressers, two federations for hairdressers and beauticians in our country, the enthusiasm is a lot less than among politicians.###21###NL_122###[]###[]###[]
Many hairdressers and beauticians do not see a division in terms of treatments, according to the federations.###22###NL_122###[]###[]###[]
"""Where do you ultimately draw the line?"###23###NL_122###[]###[]###[]
"Then a barber is not going to be able to open the door, and the vast majority of beauty salon treatments are done in the face, so they will remain closed as well."""###24###NL_122###[]###[]###[]
The proposal to add self-testing to the current protocol also falls on a cold stone.###26###NL_122###[]###[]###[]
The federations cite a survey that would show that six in 10 (surveyed) salon owners no longer want an additional measure.###27###NL_122###[]###[]###[]
"""While medical contact professions such as dentists and physiotherapists do not even have to apply half as many measures."###29###NL_122###[]###[]###[]
Continuing this unreasonable approach is unmentionable for the industry.###30###NL_122###[]###[]###[]
"The federations maintain that they nevertheless remain ""constructive."""###32###NL_122###[]###[]###[]
Further, it sounds that the barbers and beauty specialists are simply counting on being able to reopen on April 26, the date that was predetermined that they would have to remain closed at least until then.###33###NL_122###[]###[]###[]
"The federations also argue that a financial recovery plan is ""a must."""###34###NL_122###[]###[]###[]

"The North Korean leader also told Putin that the US was ""in bad faith"" at the denuclearization summit between Trump and Kim in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi."###6###NL_146###[]###[]###[]

Last weekend, more was revealed about the roles of dredging company Van Oord, ING and the Dutch state's credit insurer Atradius in a major urban renewal project, Corimba Boulevard, in the Angolan capital, Luanda.###8###NL_151###[]###[]###[]
The publication came as part of the ICIJ, the international consortium of investigative journalists, on the Angola land grab.###12###NL_151###[]###[]###[]
And the billions that disappeared in the process into the pockets of Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of the former president.###13###NL_151###[]###[]###[]
ICIJ obtained 715,000 documents from Dos Santos' private administration through African whistleblowers.###14###NL_151###[]###[]###[]
"A Dos Santos company, Urbinvest, was client of the ""Corimba Boulevard"" for which Van Oord would connect several islets off the coast of the metropolis of millions."###16###NL_151###[]###[]###[]
Atradius insured that sum.###18###NL_151###[]###[]###[]
For this project, her company claimed millions in vague costs.###21###NL_151###[]###[]###[]
Van Oord could have known about the evictions.###23###NL_151###[]###[]###[]
The company says it only signed the contract in 2016, but the documents show that talks about the project were underway before the three thousand families were evicted.###24###NL_151###[]###[]###[]
That Minister Sigrid Kaag (Foreign Trade, D66) now wants to talk to Van Oord is a first step.###25###NL_151###[]###[]###[]

Deal on historic cut in oil production is in place###1###NL_157###[]###[]###[]
This was confirmed by Saudi, Kuwaiti and Mexican ministers.###4###NL_157###[]###[]###[]
That amounts to some 10 percent of global production.###6###NL_157###[]###[]###[]
The measure will remain in effect for at least two months.###7###NL_157###[]###[]###[]
The historic deal was largely in place by Friday.###9###NL_157###[]###[]###[]
According to news agency Bloomberg, theUnited States, Canada and Brazil together are scaling back their daily production by 3.7 million barrels.###18###NL_157###[]###[]###[]
That they agreed to that measure is not too big a surprise.###19###NL_157###[]###[]###[]
Due to the corona pandemic and its associated impact on the economy, demand for the black gold was down anyway.###20###NL_157###[]###[]###[]
Analysts estimate that demand is down by a third now that about half the world's population is in a lockdown regime.###21###NL_157###[]###[]###[]
The key question is whether the historic deal is enough to put a floor under oil prices.###22###NL_157###[]###[]###[]
Recently, it even dipped below $25 a barrel for a while.###24###NL_157###[]###[]###[]
Goldman Sachs and UBS predicted last week that a 15 percent contraction in oil production would not even be enough to stop the price drop.###25###NL_157###[]###[]###[]

1,700 additional spots needed for minor asylum seekers###1###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
By January 1, 1,700 additional reception places are needed for minor aliens (unaccompanied minors), writes State Secretary Eric van der Burg (Asylum Affairs) to municipalities.###2###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
Low point.###4###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
Van der Burg makes the call partly on behalf of the Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers (COA) and guardianship organization Nidos.###6###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
Currently, 100 to 150 minors are knocking on Ter Apel's door for asylum every week.###7###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
In recent weeks, these children have regularly had to sleep on chairs because there is no bed for them.###8###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
Ter Apel.###9###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
Far too many children are accommodated at the various special reception sites for minor asylum seekers.###10###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
The maximum capacity is far exceeded in a number of locations.###11###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
"""Most worrisome"" is the situation in Ter Apel, Van der Burg writes."###12###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
A maximum of 55 children can be accommodated there, but occupancy has far exceeded that for more than a year and a half.###13###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
"""That ranged from more than 200 to days where the occupancy was even more than 300 amv."###14###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
Unacceptable.###15###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
'This is unacceptable as far as I am concerned,' Van der Burg writes.###18###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
Insufficient.###19###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
So far, he believes, municipalities are not sufficiently forthcoming.###20###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
And again, he asks each county to release 25 to 30 single-family homes for this group.###22###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
COA will look for additional space within existing and new asylum seekers' centers (azc's) to accommodate children.###23###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
If existing small-scale shelters, now designed for adults, also prove suitable for children, they will be given priority.###24###NL_163###[]###[]###[]
COA will approach municipalities for this.###25###NL_163###[]###[]###[]

NU+ | Will energy companies benefit from price cap?###1###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
'Books must open'###2###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
The surprise was palpable when the ACM came to the House of Representatives last week to explain its oversight of energy companies' profits.###3###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
That is secret.###5###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
If it becomes known how much profit is considered reasonable, all companies would start making that maximum profit, according to the ACM.###6###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
So then prices go up even further.###7###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
Therefore, even the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate does not know how much profit the regulator considers reasonable.###8###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
"""Wow,"" responded SP MP Renske Leijten."###9###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
"""The ACM is asking us to trust them on their blue eyes."###11###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
"I don't,"" she tells NU.nl."###12###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
Court is critical.###13###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
Earlier this year, the Trade and Industry Appeals Tribunal ruled on another case between the ACM and Essent.###15###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
According to the regulator, Essent had overcharged for power in 2018.###16###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
The regulator may only use that model to signal when companies may be overcharging.###18###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
"The ACM cannot force a reduction in rates with only ""a reference to a (secret) assessment model."""###19###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
Fear of high prices.###20###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
It is not yet clear whether and how supervision of energy companies will be strengthened if the price cap is implemented.###23###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
Consumers will suffer much less next year when power and gas prices are high: the government will pay anything above the ceiling price anyway.###25###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
Only when usage exceeds 1,200 cubic feet of gas and 2,900 kilowatt-hours of electricity do consumers start feeling the full energy price themselves.###26###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
"""We no longer have any competition."###28###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
"Consumers have a guaranteed price and suppliers are reimbursed for their additional costs."""###29###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
"""The energy companies need to open all the books."""###31###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
This is how the price cap works From January 1, maximum rates for energy will apply: 1.45 euros per cubic meter of gas (up to 1,200 cubic meters) and 40 euro cents per kilowatt hour (up to 2,900 kWh).###32###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
The government transfers money to energy companies in advance.###33###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
They must use that money to reimburse the difference between the market price and the ceiling price.###34###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
Only afterwards is it checked whether all the money transferred has indeed reached the consumer, and whether the supplier is charging reasonable rates.###35###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
The total cost of the price cap is highly uncertain, due to the highly volatile market prices for gas and electricity.###36###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
The cabinet expects costs of between 10 and 40 billion euros over 2023.###37###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
Expensive procurement.###38###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
The price cap also removes the incentive for energy companies to buy competitively themselves.###39###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
"""A company that doesn't procure properly will simply be reimbursed,"" Mulder said."###40###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
Under the price cap, it will be difficult to judge companies on this, the professor believes.###42###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
According to VVD MP Silvio Erkens, the cabinet should try that anyway.###43###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
He wants the ministry to determine what purchasing prices are approximately reasonable.###44###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
If companies have overpaid, they should pay for it themselves.###45###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
"""You still have to keep an incentive so they buy in efficiently."""###46###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
A spokesman for Energy Minister Rob Jetten said that work is still in progress to further develop the price cap.###47###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
In doing so, the ministry is also looking at how oversight of billion-dollar payments to energy companies will work.###48###NL_171###[]###[]###[]
More should become known in the coming weeks.###49###NL_171###[]###[]###[]

This is a greater number of deaths than the RIVM reported exactly a week ago (21).###10###NL_213###[]###[]###[]
In addition, ten new hospitalizations are reported.###11###NL_213###[]###[]###[]

Switzerland sees exports of expensive watches collapse Switzerland exported more than 81 percent fewer watches in April 2020 than in April last year, figures from the Federation of Swiss Watchmakers show.###31###NL_213###[]###[]###[]
A total of just under 329 million Swiss francs (equivalent to 310 million euros) worth of watches were sold in April.###32###NL_213###[]###[]###[]
The drop in exports of these luxury items, as in so many other sectors, is due to the corona crisis.###33###NL_213###[]###[]###[]
Because of the virus outbreak, the production of watches was lower, they were less able to be distributed and simply sold less.###34###NL_213###[]###[]###[]

The next Consultation Committee will take place on December 15 , at which time the measures will be evaluated.###39###NL_218###[]###[]###[]
This is according to research conducted by the University Hospital of Antwerp (UZA).###2###NL_219###[]###[]###[]

Patients make fewer antibodies, especially after their second shot.###5###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
This is according to research conducted by the University Hospital of Antwerp (UZA).###6###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
Side effects in patients undergoing cancer treatment were also examined.###7###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
Some patients undergoing cancer treatment produce fewer antibodies when vaccinated.###8###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
This is according to a study by the University Hospital Antwerp, in collaboration with Sciensano and Fight Against Cancer. 200 cancer patients were administered the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine for the study.###9###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
Blood samples were taken at various times to examine the production of antibodies.###10###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
Side effects were also thoroughly identified.###11###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
The side effects were not too bad.###12###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
"These are ""comparable to reports made by healthy individuals,"" according to department head of oncology Marc Peeters (UZA), he says in the video below."###13###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
Thus, patients undergoing cancer treatment have no more (or less) side effects than people without cancer.###14###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
The immune system begins producing antibodies and neutralizing antibodies after the first shot.###16###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
These are capable of eliminating the virus.###17###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
This is true in healthy people and also in patients undergoing cancer treatment.###18###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
After the second prick, Marc Peeters says there is a clear difference between healthy people and some groups of patients undergoing cancer treatment.###20###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
"""Antibodies are produced in most patients, but to a lesser extent in some treatment groups."""###21###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
However, the reduced immune response is not there with all cancer treatments.###24###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
Rituximab is used to treat lymphoma, among other things.###28###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
It suppresses part of the immune system.###29###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
Other cancer treatments seem to affect the effect of vaccination less.###30###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
Thus, the immune response was quite normal in patients treated with immunotherapy and with hormonal treatments.###31###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
The study has practical implications.###33###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
"""Further research will reveal whether they produce a greater amount of antibodies that way."""###36###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
The effect of such a third prick will be studied further in the coming months.###37###NL_219###[]###[]###[]
Netherlands Mediagenic disappearances & royal scoop: who is Peter R. de Vries, Holland's best-known crime journalist?###1###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
18 min###2###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
De Vries is following the case closely:###3###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
he not only attends the trials of the kidnappers and brothers-in-law Cor van Hout and Willem Holleeder, but also stays in the same hotels where the men were placed under arrest.###4###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
"De Vries is writing the book ""The Kidnapping of Alfred Heineken"" about the case, based on several interviews with Van Hout and Holleeder."###5###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
In 2009, it appears that de Vries helped financially reward Van Hout for his candor in the book about Heineken's kidnapping.###9###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
He devotes more than 40 broadcasts of his crime program to it.###13###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
They were released in 2002, having already served two-thirds of their 10-year sentence.###15###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
They were even acquitted on appeal, which is particularly exceptional.###16###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
In 2008, a new suspect is arrested.###17###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
DNA testing indicates a match, sentencing the man to 18 years in prison after all.###18###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
"From 1995 to 2012, de Vries had his own program on Dutch commercial television, ""Peter R. de Vries, crime reporter"" ."###20###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
In it, both new cases and so-called cold cases - that is, old unsolved crimes - are re-examined on the basis of reconstructions.###21###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
He will receive that award specifically for one of the episodes about the 2006 Natalee Holloway case, the American girl who disappeared without a trace in Aruba after meeting Dutchman Joran van der Sloot.###24###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
Van der Sloot admits in so many words that he dumped Holloway's corpse.###26###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
The case is being reopened, and is getting a lot of media attention in the US.###27###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
And then there is the Bruinsma case, which momentarily rocked the Dutch royal house.###29###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
When Dutch Prince Friso announced his engagement to Mabel Wisse Smit in 2003, it became known that she had a past relationship with drug lord Klaas Bruinsma.###30###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
Also, Prince Friso would have been aware of his future wife's past from the beginning of their relationship.###33###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
But Peter R. de Vries is airing an interview with Charlie da Silva, a former bodyguard of Bruinsma.###34###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
This sheds new light on the case, because da Silva that Wisse Smit was indeed the great love of Bruinsma.###35###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
More details about the affair of the future Dutch princess and the drug lord will follow in a second televised episode.###37###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
By the way, in the early 1990s de Vries and Bruinsma were regularly spotted together: so both men know each other as well.###38###NL_222###[]###[]###[]
Africa Experts Chamber committee Belgian colonial past:###1###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
19:18:00###3###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
In the special House committee looking into our colonial past, also known as the Congressional Committee, the experts presented their preliminary report.###4###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
For some a process of years, others do not want an endless debate.###6###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
There is little appetite for reparations.###7###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
Committee Chairman Wouter De Vriendt of Green had to watch the session from home due to corona.###8###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
"""Everything passes, except the past."""###9###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
That the Belgian colonial system committed serious misdeeds, experts agree.###12###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
Both under the reign of King Leopold II and during the era of Belgian Congo and after the independence of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi - then Rwanda-Urundi - the colonized peoples were physically, economically and psychologically exploited, historians and other experts say.###13###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
The expert committee gave a number of recommendations for MPs to work on now with their report.###15###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
That their work of nearly 700 pages has gaps due to lack of time, they themselves admit.###16###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
"""For example, the situation in Rwanda and Burundi has not been adequately explained, nor has the important role of the Catholic Church been examined,"" said historian Sara Van Beurden."###17###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
The committee requests additional time to work on this.###18###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
"""That cannot be reduced to mere financial compensation, apologies or the return of art objects,"" legal expert Martien Schotsmans said in nuance."###20###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
"""The basis is that truth is recognized."###22###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
"Only then will you create a support base to work on long-term recovery."""###24###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
But like the experts themselves, opinions vary within the House committee.###25###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
The recommendation of certain experts, for example, to allow regularization of sans-papiers from the countries concerned, or to engage in positive discrimination, was criticized.###26###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
"Several MPs also commented on the ""fragmented"" and ""incoherent"" nature of the report and the lack of consensus among the experts."###27###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
But the financial damages advocated by art historian Anne Wetsi Mpoma are particularly controversial.###28###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
Today's Belgians are not to blame.###30###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
The experts want the work of the special House committee to be an inclusive and transparent process that should ultimately build support for reconciliation.###32###NL_226###[]###[]###[]
Goedele Liekens of Open VLD does not want it to become an endless process that leads to nothing.###34###NL_226###[]###[]###[]

"""In any case, this track suits Ferrari better than ours because they gain a lot of time on the straights."###11###NL_244###[]###[]###[]
"That in itself is no surprise either."""###12###NL_244###[]###[]###[]
Older engine, so not at full power.###13###NL_244###[]###[]###[]
Verstappen's times could still go down on Saturday, as Red Bull used an older engine from the pool of three power units in its car for Friday.###14###NL_244###[]###[]###[]
As a result, power output was lower than normal.###15###NL_244###[]###[]###[]
"""You do notice that in the lap time on a seven-kilometer circuit,"" Verstappen explained."###16###NL_244###[]###[]###[]
"""It was a precautionary measure, tomorrow the engine will be able to run again at the normal positions, because there will be another one in it."""###17###NL_244###[]###[]###[]
Worries about the engine are not there.###18###NL_244###[]###[]###[]
Verstappen now has three engines in use this season, which is actually the limit.###19###NL_244###[]###[]###[]
From the next race in Italy, Honda's spec 4 will almost certainly come into the Red Bull and a grid penalty will follow.###20###NL_244###[]###[]###[]
At Spa, he will have to make do with the older version for a while.###21###NL_244###[]###[]###[]

Dutch in US over cold: stoking for a month and tape on doors 22:07 in Foreign Due to severe cold and punishing winds sweeping across the United States, tens of millions of Americans are facing weather warnings.###1###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
Many tens of millions of Americans are currently facing advisories like this as severe cold and punishing winds sweep across the United States.###3###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
According to the weather service, it is not often that so many warnings are in effect at the same time.###5###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
More than 1.4 million Americans are without power, especially in the eastern states.###7###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
We spoke to three Dutch people living in the U.S. about their experiences in the cold.###11###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
They agree that the current cold is not unique, but does have one thing that makes the feeling extra intense: icy wind.###12###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
Blizzard warnings are being issued in some areas of Illinois.###13###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
But in Adair, the hamlet where Dutchman Barend Wurth has lived for five years, the snow is not too bad.###14###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
"""It is especially very cold,"" he says of the temperature of -22 degrees, which feels like about -38."###15###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
"""I live in an old farmhouse and really have to make sure all the doors are closed."###16###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
"Before that, I even sealed the outside doors with tape."""###17###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
But the tape doesn't keep out all the cold.###18###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
"""On the tape now there is a layer of ice."###19###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
I have a hat on in the house and am pretty stoked.###20###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
Yesterday, today and tomorrow morning, I am expected to consume a monthly amount.###21###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
Wurth only taped the doors on the northwest side of his home, where the wind comes from.###23###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
Because it is mostly the wind that makes it cold, he says.###24###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
"""In 2019, it was also incredibly cold here, but then there was less wind."###25###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
When you go outside now, the first breath just hurts.###26###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
"The wind makes it unbearable and dangerous."""###27###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
Erna Moraine also says it: the wind makes the big difference.###28###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
Dutch has experienced several (very) cold spells in the 40 years she has lived in the United States.###29###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
"""And certainly winters with days like this, with lots of snow, wind and cold."###30###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
You can't expose your bare skin to that, including your face.###32###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
"And I think that makes it different now."""###33###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
A walk outside is not justified with the current weather conditions, Moraine said.###34###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
"""So we just walked around the mall,"" she says."###35###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
"""But many stores do now have notices hanging on the door that they are closed or closing early because of the weather."""###36###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
Frank van den Berge, who has lived in the United States since 1988, also sees the positive aspects of winter weather.###37###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
"""The snow blows across the roads here, you can hear the wind through the windows."###38###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
"It does give a kind of Christmas atmosphere."""###39###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
The Dutch American is used to cold, though.###40###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
"""It's often cold here in Wisconsin in the winter and there's often snow, actually always."###41###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
"If the wind had not been there, it would not have been so abnormal and obstructive."""###42###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
At Van den Berge in Brookfield, it is currently about -23 degrees.###43###NL_252###[]###[]###[]
"""You dress on it, with a warm coat, hat or balaclava, where only your eyes and mouth are visible."""###44###NL_252###[]###[]###[]

Terrorism funding Chairman charity foundation suspected of IS funding The World Wide Relief foundation held benefit events for victims of the Syrian civil war.###1###NL_264###[]###[]###[]
A major terrorism financing investigation for which the Justice Department arrested six men in November revolves around the Hilversum-based charity World Wide Relief.###3###NL_264###[]###[]###[]
In addition to the foreman of that foundation, Muslim preacher Fouad el B. , it now appears that chairman Mohamed el A. has also been arrested in the case.###4###NL_264###[]###[]###[]
This was confirmed by his lawyer Jan Boone.###5###NL_264###[]###[]###[]
The prosecution had so far only announced that six men had been arrested in the Netherlands and Belgium, without specifying who they were or which foundation they were affiliated with.###6###NL_264###[]###[]###[]
World Wide Relief held benefit events at mosques for victims of the Syrian civil war between 2013 and 2015.###7###NL_264###[]###[]###[]
A sum of two tons was allegedly withdrawn in cash and taken to fighters in Syria.###9###NL_264###[]###[]###[]
The suspects were released after questioning by the prosecution pending the progress of the investigation.###10###NL_264###[]###[]###[]
According to attorney Boone, this indicates that the case has little merit.###11###NL_264###[]###[]###[]
"""If you release someone two days after his arrest, you obviously don't have a reasonable suspicion of guilt."###12###NL_264###[]###[]###[]
"They just can't make the case hard."""###13###NL_264###[]###[]###[]
"The prosecution, however, informs that the investigation is still ""ongoing"" and that a final case report is awaited."###14###NL_264###[]###[]###[]
The suspects may await the course of the investigation at liberty for the time being.###15###NL_264###[]###[]###[]

"Flemish companies export parts for this A400M Middle East Flemish government in court for ""arms exports to Turkey"" 56 min"###1###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
The Flemish government says these are parts that are also used in civilian Airbus aircraft.###2###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
Even according to Europe, that is not considered arms exports.###3###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
A writ of summons against the Flemish government is being filed today in the court of first instance by Peace Action with the support of Amnesty International Belgium.###4###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
Specifically, these are parts such as nuts and bolts and wing parts.###6###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
"Not everything supplied to a foreign military is simply labeled ""arms export."""###7###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
"""Take a Flemish company that would make ballpoint pens."###8###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
Suppose that were to receive an order from a foreign military, would those ballpoint pens fall under arms export?###9###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
"Of course not,"" said one person involved in the case."###10###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
"""We do, of course, consider weapons, or parts of weapons, to be 'arms exports,'"" he said."###11###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
Already since 2013, Belgian arms companies Asco Industries, Sonaca and Safran Aero Boosters have been supplying parts of the engine, wings and landing gear of the Turkish A400M military transport aircraft.###12###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
That plane plays a role in supplying weapons and mercenaries for armed conflicts in Libya and Azerbaijan.###13###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
The question, of course, is what that has to do with Flemish exports of parts to Franco-German aircraft maker Airbus.###15###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
The parts made by Flemish companies are not always specifically designed for military use.###16###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
They are often part of the wings of almost all of Airbus' civilian aircraft, so we don't know if the specific nuts or bolts will end up in which aircraft.###17###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
Moreover, the specific device, the A400M, is also being delivered to quite a few European countries, including Belgium itself.###18###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
Our country co-developed the military transport aircraft, and therefore may also co-supply parts for the aircraft.###19###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
According to Flemish and European regulations, the Flemish, Walloon and Brussels companies produce non-essential parts (of components) of the A400M.###20###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
So these are parts (of parts) that can also be found in civilian aircraft in slightly modified form, including the slabs and wing parts.###21###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
Shouldn't those companies know who the end customer is for their parts?###22###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
""" European Directive 2009/43 explicitly prohibits restrictions on intra-European trade of non-essential components."###23###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
"""Flanders has actually been one of the toughest students in Europe's 'arms export class' for some time now"" says the person involved."###25###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
"""Although of course that is not so difficult for us, Flanders actually has little or no real arms industry."###26###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
"In Wallonia, of course, with companies like FN and John Cockerill, it is different."""###27###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
"But for the parts of the A400M, he does have a different consideration: ""The parts supplied by Flemish companies are not piecework for the Turkish Air Force or any user of the A400M aircraft."###29###NL_276###[]###[]###[]
"It is about non-essential parts that are produced in bulk and delivered to another supplier for integration into another part; so there is also no delivery to the system integrator."""###30###NL_276###[]###[]###[]

MEPs are gathering in Strasbourg today as scheduled.###3###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
Yet for once, political current events will not be at the top of the agenda.###4###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
On Friday, the Greek vice president, Eva Kaili, was arrested in our country.###6###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
Normally she enjoys parliamentary immunity, but she was caught red-handed with a bag full of currency bills, which allowed her to be arrested anyway.###7###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
She allegedly received bribes from Qatar, which is currently hosting the World Cup, for influencing decisions in parliament and promoting a positive image of Qatar.###9###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
Among her colleagues, the reaction is outraged.###10###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
She has also been wide-eyed at the images of Kaili now circulating, in which the Greek praises human rights in Qatar.###12###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
"""With hindsight, of course, it's easy to talk."###13###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
But Kaili is actually not at all concerned with human rights in parliament.###14###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
"So you could ask yourself why she suddenly came up with Qatar,"" Van Brempt said."###15###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
Kaili, meanwhile, was expelled from her group and suspended as vice president.###16###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
Belgium is also involved.###17###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
But the scandal is not limited to Kaili alone.###18###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
F.G., parliamentary assistant for the Social Democrats and partner of Kaili, was also arrested.###19###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
That assistant worked in the past for former Italian MEP Antonio Panzeri.###20###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
In turn, 600,000 euros in cash was found in his house.###21###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
According to Italian media, his wife and daughter were also arrested in Italy following a European arrest warrant.###22###NL_293###[]###[]###[]

The office of an associate of Marc Tarabella (PS) was also sealed.###27###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
But on Saturday night, investigators also raided Tarabella's own home.###28###NL_293###[]###[]###[]
European Parliament President Roberta Metsola flew back to Belgium from Malta especially for this purpose.###29###NL_293###[]###[]###[]

Cashless###1###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
Nearly 90 percent of Belgians prefer to pay digitally.###2###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
Even so, 63 percent of purchases in retail stores in our country are still paid with cash, a survey by the banking federation Febelfin reveals.###3###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
So there is strong consumer demand for cashless payments, but supply is not following.###4###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
In a lot of larger commercial establishments - clothing boutiques, shoe stores, restaurants, gas stations - paying by card is commonplace, especially if they are chains.###5###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
But quite a few (retail) merchants - think butchers, bakers, sandwich stores, French fry stores, who usually deal with smaller amounts - only accept cash.###6###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
That argument is becoming less and less valid.###8###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
The cost to merchants of electronic payments has fallen.###9###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
And they forget that cash payments also have fees associated with them, although sometimes they remain hidden.###10###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
Another advantage is that electronic money cannot just disappear from the till - admittedly some will see that as a disadvantage - and it facilitates financial administration.###11###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
But that is not a valid argument.###13###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
Technological developments have greatly increased the ease of use of electronic payments in recent years.###14###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
It is no longer the cause of exasperating traffic jams at store checkouts.###15###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
Thanks to applications such as contactless payment by bank card or smartphone, this is faster than cash payments.###16###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
Banks have also developed apps to make digital payments easier, for consumers and merchants.###17###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
How archaic is it when shoppers first pass by an ATM to take money out of the wall, then use those bills to pay for their purchases in a store, and the merchant later has to go back to the bank with those bills to have them added to his account?###18###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
By reducing the number of bill machines.###21###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
Or by charging fees for those who withdraw cash, even from their own account.###22###NL_300###[]###[]###[]
The consumer organization Test-Achats is fighting the wrong battle by attacking the banks that do so.###23###NL_300###[]###[]###[]

Cashless payment is a form of progress.###25###NL_300###[]###[]###[]

Corum Private Hospital si Neurology Specialist Uzm.###2###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Dr.###3###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
In his statement on June 21, World ALS Day, Okan Delikan gave information about ALS disease and diagnosis.###4###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
WHAT IS ALS, MOTOR NEURON DISEASE?###5###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Stating that ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) and Motor Neuron Disease are generally used in the same sense in the world, Uzm.###6###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Dr.###7###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
"Okan Delikan said, ""The 2 groups of nerve cells of the system that makes voluntary movements (pyramidal system) are called motorneurons."###8###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
The nerve cells from the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord are called first motor neurons (upper motor neurons).###9###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
The electrical impulses generated in the motor center of our brain are transmitted to the spinal cord by a nerve cell called the 1st motor neuron (alpha motor neuron).###10###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
The second motor neuron (lower motor neuron) starts in the region of the spinal cord called the anterior horn. The passage of electrical impulses between the 1st and 2nd motor neuron takes place through chemical processes in a space called the synapse.###11###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
The electrical impulse transmitted from the synapse gap to the 2nd motor neuron is transmitted from the spinal cord to the relevant muscle area.###12###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
With this electrical impulse, our muscles work.###13###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Diseases affecting the first and/or second motor neuron are generally referred to as Motor Neuron Disease.###14###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
ALS is just one of the diseases that affect these nerves.###15###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
"Many factors such as certain environmental factors such as pesticides and heavy metals, hormonal disorders, vitamin deficiency, viruses, cancer have been suspected to cause the disease, but there has not been enough evidence for any of them."""###17###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Uzm. Dr. Okan Delikan gave the following information about ALS: WHO CAN GET ALS?###18###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
"ALS is not a contagious disease; it can occur anywhere in the world and in people from all walks of life."###19###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
It is slightly more common in men.###20###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
The average age of onset is 55 years.###21###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
However, it can occur at a very young age or at a very advanced age.###22###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
About 2-6 per 100,000 of the population has ALS.###23###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?###24###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Symptoms are not the same in every patient.###25###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Usually, weakness or thinning in one arm or leg is the first symptom the patient notices.###26###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
"For example, it becomes difficult to hold a pen, button a button, carry a bag; or the patient stumbles when walking."###27###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
In some patients, the disease starts with speech or swallowing difficulties.###28###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
The patient or relatives notice a lisp or nasal speech.###29###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
These symptoms may be accompanied by muscle twitching, pain and cramps.###30###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
There may be uncontrollable crying and laughing.###31###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR ALS?###32###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Of all ALS patients, 90% are sporadic (individual) and 10% are familial ALS patients.###33###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Half of familial ALS patients are also inherited.###34###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
It can therefore be said that the disease is largely unrelated to heredity.###35###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Another characteristic of ALS patients is that they fit a certain personality profile.###36###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Some epidemiologic data suggest an association between overexertion or certain chemicals and this disease, but there is no definitive proof.###38###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
ARE THERE STAGES OF THE DISEASE?###40###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Over time, the weakness spreads from where it started to other areas, such as the muscles of the arms, legs, tongue and pharynx.###41###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
He cannot eat, dress or bathe.###44###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
He may not even get out of bed.###45###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
The critical period of the disease is when the respiratory muscles also weaken.###46###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
The course of ALS is different for each patient.###48###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Although survival is usually given as 4-6 years, there are many patients who live 10 years or more.###49###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
There are ALS patients who live more than 20 years with good medical and social support.###50###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
The reason for this difference is not fully known.###51###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
HOW IS THE DIAGNOSIS MADE?###52###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and symptoms.###53###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Nevertheless, the disease can be confused with many muscle and nerve diseases, so some tests are necessary.###54###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
An electromyogram (EMG) performed by an experienced electroneurophysiologist is the diagnostic tool.###55###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord, some blood and urine tests, lumbar puncture (examination of lumbar fluid), muscle biopsy may be required, as they may be confused with other diseases.###56###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
WHICH SYMPTOMS SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT?###57###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
"The physician checks for distinctive neuronal signs including; muscle atrophy (loss of muscle volume), muscle weakness, twitching, increased muscle tone, changes in normal muscle reflexes."###58###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
If the neurologist finds signs of motor neurons in at least three parts of the patient's body, a definitive diagnosis of MNH can be made.###59###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
IS THERE A CURE FOR THE DISEASE?###60###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Special medication for ALS patients is used to reduce the amount of glutamate in the body, thus slowing the progression of the disease.###63###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
Today, there are many possibilities for rehabilitation of the patient.###66###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
These are determined according to the needs of each patient.###67###TR_026###[]###[]###[]
"Drug treatments for muscle pain, cramps and muscle stiffness (spasticity), treatment with a psychiatric approach to patients and their relatives for changes in emotional state, treatment of speech problems with a speech therapist, medication for increased salivation and swallowing problems or tube feeding treatment called PEG, pain treatment, tracheotomy or connection to a respirator for the treatment of respiratory problems."""###68###TR_026###[]###[]###[]

Orwell expressed the internalization of surveillance as follows: 'The assumption that your every sound was heard, that your every move was watched unless you were in the dark, had become an instinctive habit, you had to live with it - you did'.###5###TR_052###[]###[]###[]

Imamo?lu: ISKI Cannot Supply Water Below Cost###1###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IBB) Mayor Ekrem ?mamo?lu held a press conference on the rejection of his proposal for a raise in ISKI.###2###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
"Speaking at the meeting held at ISKOM (Istanbul Water Control and Automation Center) in Ey�psultan G�zeltepe Neighborhood, Imamo?lu said, ""ISKI, so to speak, is like the vein of life, like a vein of the human body... This is what it means for Istanbul."###3###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
"ISKI is an ancient institution."""###5###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
"""But today, I am here to share with you a really evil game being played against our Istanbul,"" Imamo?lu said, adding, ""For 2 years, I have been talking about ISKI without getting involved in the issue, patiently, by setting up common tables, by talking face to face many times and while making these negotiations, We have shared all the accounts of ISKI with all the political stakeholders in IBB, without discriminating between political parties, both to the parliamentary commissions and the deputy group chairmen in the parliament, and the sensitive situation of ISKI, both myself, our general manager and other executives, with great effort,"" he said."###6###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
"Stating that the budget of 10 billion 300 million liras for ?SK? increased to 14 billion 900 million liras in November, ?mamo?lu said to the deputy group chairmen, ""Let's put a price tariff for Istanbul."###7###TR_073###[]###[]###[]

According to my friends' estimates, according to the current electricity tariff, the electricity bill in 2022 will exceed 3 billion liras.###19###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
It's as simple as that.###20###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
There is no need to jump up and down.###21###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
Did I raise the electricity?###22###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
I didn't do it.###23###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
Conclusion.###24###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
We are talking about the result.###25###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
The reason is elsewhere, not us.###26###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
Diesel, 135 percent.###27###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
"Eurasia Tunnel; you will say, 'What does it have to do with anything?"###28###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
ISKI should not raise the price, but Eurasia Tunnel should.###29###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
Simple.###30###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
127 percent.###31###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
Last year, the dollar was 7.5 liras.###33###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
Today it is 13.5 liras.###34###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
"Three to 300 percent on some items."""###36###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
"Giving examples of the chemicals in question and their costs, ?mamo?lu said, ""As a result, in just one year, the costs of our ISKI organization, which supplies water to our Istanbul, have increased by 120 percent."###37###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
We have to bring it.###39###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
What did we say?###40###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
"We said, ""Let the increase be 50 percent for users up to 10 cubic meters, so that our citizens who use water economically or who have low income will be affected a little less."###41###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
Look, our cost is 120 percent from 2021 to 2022, but we say, 'Let it be 50 percent.###42###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
When we introduce a new price tariff, we also take into account some negative budget.###43###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
I will talk about why it is a crime.###45###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
Why?###46###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
"For those who use at a higher level, that is, those who consume excessive water, we said that this increase should be 80 percent."""###48###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
"I mean, everyone knows very well what is what,"" ?mamo?lu said, adding, ""A friend comes out and says, '90 percent, 179 percent, 180 percent raise offer'."###50###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
Do you know why?###52###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
These are the deputy group chairmen of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality.###54###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
There is math.###56###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
My friend may not understand what I am saying, but when you divide the increase figure by the previous price, you will find the rate of increase.###57###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
It is the most basic rule in mathematics.###58###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
I think this is now taught in the second or third grade of primary school.###59###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
I don't understand how this friend came up with 179 percent, with what mind, with what education.###60###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
Therefore, all these are lies.###61###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
"It is not right,"" he said."###62###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
Believe me, this will happen in the very short term.###67###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
"Now you think about it,"" he said."###68###TR_073###[]###[]###[]
"Dr. Kai-Uwe Herthneck, a psychotherapist, recently came across the article ""How did humanity come into existence?"" written by Mr. Li Hongzhi."###2###TR_074###[]###[]###[]
This is very valuable.###5###TR_074###[]###[]###[]
But these are not true and virtuous guiding principles.###14###TR_074###[]###[]###[]
These are the ideas that have enslaved humanity for so long and have made people suffer.###15###TR_074###[]###[]###[]
In fact, the opposite is the case: Only those who can remain compassionate in the midst of pain, suffering and conflict will truly attain virtue.###16###TR_074###[]###[]###[]
Of course, this is not only the case in Buddhist-Taoist culture.###17###TR_074###[]###[]###[]
These are facts that have been known since ancient Greek civilization, that is, since Plato and Aristotle.###18###TR_074###[]###[]###[]
If that is the case, how can we reach a higher level of compassion?###19###TR_074###[]###[]###[]
We certainly cannot achieve this through violence, war, domination and oppression.###20###TR_074###[]###[]###[]
Only through really good and sincere behavior can we succeed.###21###TR_074###[]###[]###[]
It is not just about internalizing a rational and good theory.###24###TR_074###[]###[]###[]
Because a theory or fact cannot be both good and true at the same time.###27###TR_074###[]###[]###[]
Because in any case, with his death, everything will lose its meaning.###32###TR_074###[]###[]###[]

President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an made statements at the Opening Ceremony of ?smail Fehmi Cumal?o?lu City Hospital in Tekirda?.###2###TR_083###[]###[]###[]
Speaking at the ceremony, President Erdo?an stated that today was his fifth visit to Tekirda? and reminded that he had previously visited the city on different occasions when he was Prime Minister.###3###TR_083###[]###[]###[]
So, who is this Ismail Fehmi Cumalioglu?###10###TR_083###[]###[]###[]
Our brother Fehmi was born in 1912, born in Hayrabolu, Tekirda?.###11###TR_083###[]###[]###[]
He is also a doctor, but he is also a politician.###12###TR_083###[]###[]###[]
"While I was on my way by helicopter, Mr. Mustafa, the Speaker of the Assembly, said; Mr. Fehmi is from here, he is also a doctor."###14###TR_083###[]###[]###[]

It has also been observed that some politicians first show sensitivity, tweet and then delete their tweets.###13###TR_085###[]###[]###[]
The authorities have been following the case from day one.###14###TR_085###[]###[]###[]
However, the investigation is ongoing and after it is over, it will be revealed how the fire started here.###16###TR_085###[]###[]###[]

If there is a power that does not know the value of negotiation and diplomacy and wants to usurp the rights of Turkey and the TRNC, we are ready to respond to it.###37###TR_085###[]###[]###[]
Greece is trying to produce a 40 thousand kilometer maritime jurisdiction area over Meis Island by bringing an occupation paper and a rag called the Seville Agreement in front of us.###39###TR_085###[]###[]###[]
Can something so absurd happen?###40###TR_085###[]###[]###[]
Our President said we will not be the side that runs away from the table.###42###TR_085###[]###[]###[]
Instead, we have too much diplomatic experience to turn a blind eye to those who abuse the table.###43###TR_085###[]###[]###[]

Banned Social Media Platforms in China###1###TR_088###[]###[]###[]
Since the 1990s, the use of internet has become widespread in the world with the introduction of web2.0 based systems.###2###TR_088###[]###[]###[]
Thanks to this system, which enables people to interact with each other via audio and video, the whole world has started to be aware of each other.###3###TR_088###[]###[]###[]
Moving from a passive to an active position, users communicate with the world by producing content on virtual communication platforms such as social media, news sites and blogs, independent of time and space.###5###TR_088###[]###[]###[]
The differences in the political, economic and technological situation of countries also show differences in the use of new media by their users.###6###TR_088###[]###[]###[]
Social media platforms, which are used in many countries around the world today, are not used in some countries.###7###TR_088###[]###[]###[]
North Korea, Iran and China are among these countries.###9###TR_088###[]###[]###[]
In other words, the CCP has banned the use of social networks whose source is outside China and which it cannot control. As of 2018, there are approximately 1 billion internet users in China, with a population of 1.4 billion.###14###TR_088###[]###[]###[]

Although Google maps was open in the early days, it too was blocked after Taiwan was recognized as an independent country.###20###TR_088###[]###[]###[]
This is because although Taiwan is an independent country, it is seen by China as a dependent country of China.###21###TR_088###[]###[]###[]
Looking at these and similar surveys, it leaves a question mark on how much the people living in China are aware of what is happening in the world.###24###TR_088###[]###[]###[]

Samsun was a strategically important and reliable gateway from the Black Sea to Central Anatolia.###8###TR_093###[]###[]###[]

Trump Meets with Falun Gong Practitioner Survivor of Chinese Persecution###1###TR_117###[]###[]###[]

Ms. Zhang also told Trump about another practitioner who was imprisoned in the same place and died the day after his release.###9###TR_117###[]###[]###[]

How does the Wood Wide Web work?###1###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
The forest is a social environment for trees.###2###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Trees are also social beings.###3###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Trees spread their roots underground with fine fibers to find moist ground in the soil.###5###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
In the process, they mate with fungi.###6###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Trees that are close to each other communicate through their roots and branches.###7###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
But fungi play an important role in the communication of trees that are not close to each other.###8###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Mushrooms can easily penetrate into the soil with their reticulated structure.###9###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Trees also send signals to each other through fungal networks in their roots.###10###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Even in rainy, stormy weather, they send news in this way, albeit slowly, regardless of the weather.###11###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
They have a very slow electrical speed of 1 cm per second.###12###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Mushrooms work just like a fiber optic internet network.###13###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
With their thread-like structure, they move easily deep into the soil.###14###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
A single mushroom can bind an entire forest together.###15###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
These fungal networks are like a forest internetwork.###16###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
(Wood wide web forest internet network) Trees that lose this communication network often get sick.###17###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Fungi are living things that fall between animals and plants.###18###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
The cell structure of fungi sets them apart from plants.###19###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
They have cell walls called chitin, which plants lack.###20###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
This makes them closer to pests.###21###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Fungi do not photosynthesize like plants.###22###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Fungi owe their existence to the organic bonds they form with other living things.###23###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Fungi can spread over large areas with their underground cottony webs called suckers.###24###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
In Switzerland, there is a thousand-year-old honey fungus spread over an area half a kilometer wide.###25###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Another mushroom in Oregon is estimated to be 2400 years old and is said to weigh 600 kg, covering an area of 9 square kilometers.###26###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
According to this, fungi are the largest living organisms in the world.###27###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Fungi are living things between animals and plants.###30###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Every tree has to expand its roots to get food and water from the soil.###31###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
For this, each tree works with the most suitable mushroom species.###32###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
For example, the oak tree works with oak cork.###34###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
The fungi attach to the hairs on the roots of the tree and spread where they are found.###35###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
From there it can spread to other trees.###36###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
They ask trees for a third of the sugar the tree has in exchange for their services.###40###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
They remove some harmful bacteria.###42###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Some trees of different species compete with each other, while others feed each other.###44###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Beech trees, for example, are said to be able to be friends with others.###45###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Trees don't want to lose their friends.###46###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
This is because the disturbance of gaps in the forest affects the air humidity balance.###47###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Especially trees grown for commercial use need plenty of space.###48###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
These trees should get a lot of sun, photosynthesize and grow quickly.###49###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
When trees are too close together, they can interfere with each other's use of sun and water. pixabay.###50###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Vanessa Burche, a student at the University of St. Achen, discovered that beech trees help each other even when they are in different places.###51###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
The tree with more sugar gives it to the tree with less through its roots.###52###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Usually foresters cut them down because they think that trees should not be too close to each other.###55###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
But a beech forest in L�beck, northern Germany, with dense stands of trees, yielded too much.###56###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
The trees fed each other better when they were close to each other.###57###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
This runs counter to the evolutionary theory of survival of the fittest.###59###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Because the health of trees depends on them being together.###60###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
The heat and sun pierce the soil of the forest and disrupt the humid cool climate.###62###TR_121###[]###[]###[]
Even seemingly strong trees get sick from time to time.###63###TR_121###[]###[]###[]

After Meeting the Son of Pro-Democracy Zhao Ziyang###1###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
Comment.###2###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
By Gobi East, January 17 was the 16th anniversary of the death of former Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Zhao Ziyang.###3###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
The Chinese regime has since banned all media from reporting on Zhao.###7###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
My problem with the Chinese authorities began in 2009 after a brief encounter with Zhao Erjun, the second child of Zhao Ziyang.###8###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
During the Spring Festival, I was visiting my friend Shi Lei in Guangzhou.###9###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
I recently found an old photo of the three of us.###10###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
The day after I returned to Shanghai from Guangzhou, I was contacted by Chen Youwu, an officer of the Political Security Department of the Shanghai police bureau.###12###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
My friend Shi died in 2010.###14###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
He was a retired commander who had run a small airport in the Air Force.###15###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
Since then, many things have happened to me that seem surreal.###18###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
But one thing is certain: The CCP is keeping a very close eye on the Zhao family and those who are directly or indirectly involved with them.###19###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
I stayed at a friend's house.###21###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
"They even killed my friend's guard dog, and to keep me away they sent a group of old men every day to sing patriotic ""red"" songs in front of the house."###22###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
But then I was imprisoned for seven years for political dissent.###26###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
All this happened to me because I live in a country ruled by the worst regime in the world.###29###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
I ran away to New York.###30###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
During my time there, I wanted to work as a campaign assistant for a local congressman.###31###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
But someone tried to persuade me to abandon my anti-communist stance on the grounds that I would offend pro-communist groups in the state.###32###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
But this person could not convince me.###33###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
Recently, I was saddened to come across a post on Twitter claiming that the Chinese people are satisfied with the CCP.###36###TR_124###[]###[]###[]
But one thing is for sure: I will never stop defending justice and truth.###44###TR_124###[]###[]###[]

Sevilay Y?lman, a vaccine volunteer, rebelled: I couldn't find out what was done to me, I went crazy###1###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
"Noting that she called many officials on the subject but could not learn the results, Y?lman said, ""If 1 million people in the country have already received the vaccine, what is the wait to announce the results of the study in which we were the subjects?"###3###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
"I really went crazy."""###4###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
I scratched it.###6###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
But as a volunteer participating in the Phase 3 trials of the Sinovac vaccine in Turkey, I had to write because I couldn't find out what was done or not done to me and I was going crazy.###7###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
It's a joke, really.###8###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
The vaccine I volunteered and participated in the trial was approved and is already being used in the country.###9###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
But I still don't know whether I, as a subject, was vaccinated or placebo in that study!###10###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
"The company conducting the study told us all about 10 days ago; ""Within the scope of the Covid-19 vaccine study, health workers will be primarily blinded with the guidance of the Ministry of Health and you will be notified by message which arm you are included in according to the time of your inclusion in the study."###11###TR_132###[]###[]###[]

Almost every day I call the Ministry of Health officials who were instrumental in my volunteering.###15###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
But I can't learn.###16###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
Because the officials I called don't know anything either.###17###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
"This is what they said: ""It will be announced soon, don't worry!"""###18###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
Let's not worry about me, after all, I don't have the luxury of getting vaccinated right now.###19###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
At this rate, it may be summer before it's my turn.###20###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
What about the health workers who volunteered during that study?###21###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
What about them?###22###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
I know a lot of doctors, nurses, hospital workers who volunteer.###23###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
What will those people do if the experiment is placebo?###24###TR_132###[]###[]###[]
Don't they miss their turn?###25###TR_132###[]###[]###[]

Varicose veins treatment should be personalized###1###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
"Cardiovascular Surgeon Op. Dr. Aybanu G�k�en said, ""Varicose vein treatment should be personalized""."###2###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
Op. Dr. Aybanu G�k�en stated that varicose veins vary from person to person in terms of the structure of the vein system.###3###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
Stating that the human body has an extremely unique and unique structure, Op.###4###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
Dr.###5###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
Therefore, the venous system varies from person to person in terms of its structure and spreads in a different direction in each person, resulting in different vascular formations, tissue changes and different clinical findings.###7###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
"This will naturally require personalized diagnosis and treatment."""###8###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
"Dr. Aybanu G�k�en stated that personalized varicose vein treatment consists of four main processes and said the following: ""Listening to complaints, physical examination, vein mapping, treatment and follow-up."###9###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
In the first stage, the patient's complaints are listened to in detail and it is determined whether they are really related to varicose veins.###10###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
In addition, varicose veins are not a disease, they are the most common symptom of venous hypertension (high blood pressure in the veins).###13###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
This approach forms the basis of treatment planning.###14###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
"It is necessary to find and eliminate not only varicose veins but also the underlying cause of high blood pressure."""###15###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
"Stating that the second stage is the process of creating a ""vascular map"" of the patient, Dr."###16###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
This is where 'doppler ultrasonography' comes into play to clarify all these unknowns.###18###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
Doppler ultrasonography is an essential 'gold standard'.###19###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
Each person's vasculature is unique and a detailed ultrasonographic evaluation reveals a personalized vascular map.###20###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
The individualized vascular map is the roadmap for individualized treatment.###21###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
I tell all my patients the same thing, there is not the best treatment, there is the most appropriate treatment.###24###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
The most effective treatment is personalized varicose vein treatment.###25###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
Sometimes more than one treatment option may be required in the same patient.###26###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
These options can also be applied in the same session and sequentially.###27###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
Our last stage in personalized varicose vein treatment is the follow-up of the patient.###29###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
Again, individualized follow-up intervals are determined according to the condition of the patient and the disease.###30###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
"""There is no disease, there is a patient."###32###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
"Varicose veins require personalized diagnosis, personalized treatment and personalized follow-up,"" said Dr."###33###TR_151###[]###[]###[]
"G�k�en said, ""For this reason, those with varicose veins should definitely ask their doctor to make a special treatment plan for them."""###34###TR_151###[]###[]###[]

GSB 2021-2022 student loan applications this year###2###TR_165###[]###[]###[]
Criteria such as the financial status of the candidates' families, the city of education, and the number of children studying play a decisive role in the evaluation process.###4###TR_165###[]###[]###[]

The Ministry of Youth and Sports has not yet shared the application calendar with candidates.###13###TR_165###[]###[]###[]
However, based on 2021 and the history of the past years, applications are expected to start in October.###14###TR_165###[]###[]###[]
Last year, applications started in the last week of October and lasted until November.###15###TR_165###[]###[]###[]
The results were announced on December 7.###16###TR_165###[]###[]###[]
Candidates will not be in a situation such as taking documents to any institution in person.###19###TR_165###[]###[]###[]
How is Tuition Loan Repayment Made?###23###TR_165###[]###[]###[]
"Students who receive student loans are paid starting from the month two years after the end of the normal education period without waiting for notification in the ""Scholarship / Loan Commitment Letter"" they signed at the stage of receiving loans."###24###TR_165###[]###[]###[]
The debts of students who have received loans are calculated according to the amounts given as loans from the date of the loan until the end of the education period or until the date the loans are discontinued for any reason.###25###TR_165###[]###[]###[]
KYK loan repayments are paid in installments from month to month, not in a lump sum.###26###TR_165###[]###[]###[]
Attention, your scholarship may be cut!###27###TR_165###[]###[]###[]
Students who do not meet the conditions of the scholarship allocated to students by the Credit and Dormitories Institution will have their scholarship payments discontinued.###28###TR_165###[]###[]###[]
Likewise, with the change introduced in 2018, the scholarship of students with a year-end average below 2.00 in the 4-grade system is cut off. In the 100-grade system, the scholarships of students with a GPA below 53.33 will be converted into loans.###30###TR_165###[]###[]###[]

"GENAR Research Company surveyed 3 thousand people between April 28 and May 3 and asked them the question ""Who is your favorite politician?""."###2###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
"Selvi's article on the survey is as follows: ""If you think that the coronavirus is only effective in the field of health, you are wrong."###4###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
Perhaps it has had as much impact on the economy as on health.###5###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
GENAR's survey conducted with 3 thousand people between April 28 and May 3 sheds light on politics during the coronavirus days.###7###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
I would like to reflect the general trend without overwhelming you with figures.###8###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
Because Turkish politics is polarized between Erdoganists and Erdogan opponents, previous polls did not show much support for Erdogan from other parties.###11###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
Partly MHP voters were also showing interest.###13###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
This time there is also support from the grassroots of other parties.###14###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
I would like to draw your attention especially to the HDP and Saadet Party base.###15###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
ERDOGAN AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT.###16###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
We saw this in Operation Olive Branch, Operation Peace Spring, when we sent troops abroad, and in the Jerusalem vote.###20###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
Think in reverse.###23###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
SUPPORT FOR THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.###25###TR_166###[]###[]###[]

ERDO?AN CAUGHT THE MOOD BEFORE NOVEMBER 1.###29###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
I don't know if it is only related to the fight against the coronavirus, but it turns out that the AK Party's vote increased by 2.8 points compared to the June 24 elections.###30###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
When the votes of the AK Party, which increased to 45.4 percent, and the MHP, which increased to 9.8 percent, are combined, the support for the 'republic alliance' climbs to 55.2 percent.###31###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
One year ago there were local elections in this country, the AK Party lost Istanbul and Ankara, what has changed in one year?###32###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
I asked ?hsan Akta? about this.###33###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
"""CHP lost the wind it caught in the local elections,"" he said."###34###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
I think that Erdo?an's successful moves after the local elections and his success in taking the wind behind his back have also played a big role in this.###35###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
Erdo?an, who also has the support of other parties, seems to be above the 'republic alliance'.###36###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
Erdo?an captured the mood before the November 1 elections.###37###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
I?MAMO?LU AND YAVA? OVERTAKE KILI�DARO?LU.###38###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
After President Erdo?an, the leader of the main opposition party, CHP leader Kemal K?l?�daro?lu would normally be expected to come second.###39###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
But it's not like that.###40###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
K?l?�daro?lu used to be one or two steps behind.###41###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
Now it has fallen to 8th place.###42###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
K?l?�daro?lu did not make a grave mistake in this process.###43###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
That is why I called ?hsan Akta?, the President of GENAR, and asked him why.###44###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
"""Ekrem ?mamo?lu and Mansur Yava? withdrew some of K?l?�daro?lu's points,"" he said."###45###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
"Imamo?lu and Yava? are ranked higher than K?l?�daro?lu."""###46###TR_166###[]###[]###[]
Who knows this best?###4###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
Unfortunately, teachers know best.###5###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
In Turkey, the value of the teacher has diminished to almost nothing.###6###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
I wish everything was as rosy as the congratulatory messages.###7###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
A reform with the teacher at its center is essential.###10###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
If teachers lose hope, pessimism will not leave our doorstep.###12###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
If the teacher is not full, society is not full.###13###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
If a teacher is not like a teacher, a nation is not like a nation.###14###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
The teacher cannot be neglected.###15###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
You cannot build a new generation with what you have neglected.###16###TR_169###[]###[]###[]

NATIONAL SPIRIT###20###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
While there are many speeches about the meaning and importance of the day, I would like to emphasize that we should not miss the national spirit that the late Mahir ?z, one of the rare names we can show as the ideal example of the type of teacher we need for Teachers' Day, insisted on.###21###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
In other words, we must have a national education in substance, not in word.###23###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
The concept of nationality must be given its due.###24###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
Isn't this the fundamental problem we are facing?###27###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
Whatever this land has suffered from, it has suffered from the illiterate, the illiterate who have confused their direction and misplaced their qibla.###28###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
Mahir ?z, whom we can show as an example to all educators, was one of the pioneering teachers who believed in the spirit of Turkey.###29###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
Like his surname, he left his mark and aroused national feelings in hearts.###30###TR_169###[]###[]###[]

He introduced himself, I let him in, Hodja Alman.###44###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
We sat, chatted, ate and drank.###45###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
As he was leaving, he said, 'Mr. Mahir, I have come to settle a score.###46###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
We talked like this at Hal?c?o?lu Military High School and you laughed.###47###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
I came today to confirm my promise.###48###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
Ask me, you said 20 years, he did it in 15.###50###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
But they could not kill the German spirit.###53###TR_169###[]###[]###[]
As long as that spirit remains, Germany cannot be killed.###54###TR_169###[]###[]###[]

We were due to arrive in Scotland at the beginning of the month to watch the Climate Summit, which President Tayyip Erdo?an was expected to attend.###14###TR_175###[]###[]###[]
As is well known, this trip was canceled when the Scottish authorities overruled Turkey's demands regarding security protocols, and on October 31, the plane carrying Erdo?an was diverted from Rome to Istanbul instead of Glasgow.###15###TR_175###[]###[]###[]
We had already put the trip to Scotland out of our minds when, a week later, we received a new invitation.###16###TR_175###[]###[]###[]
This time, at the invitation of Murat Kurum, Minister of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change, we traveled to Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, to follow his participation in ministerial-level meetings.###17###TR_175###[]###[]###[]

Slimming down by swallowing rice: Say goodbye to your fat with the raw rice diet!###5###TR_176###[]###[]###[]
For people who want to lose weight ideally in terms of both appearance and health, the technique of swallowing raw rice will be very useful and will stop weight gain both in the short and long term.###8###TR_176###[]###[]###[]
Well, is it harmful to lose weight by swallowing rice, which is a subject that closely concerns those who want to get rid of their excess weight and accelerate fat burning?###9###TR_176###[]###[]###[]
Rice has an appetite suppressant feature if swallowed raw.###10###TR_176###[]###[]###[]
If you apply the rice swallowing method in the morning, you will be able to control your appetite during the day and you will not consume foods that contain excess calories.###11###TR_176###[]###[]###[]
However, it is important to note that only ingesting raw rice will not help you lose excess weight and burn fat.###13###TR_176###[]###[]###[]
"The method of slimming by swallowing rice is applied as follows; on the first day, only one raw rice should be swallowed."###16###TR_176###[]###[]###[]
You should swallow one grain of raw rice in the morning on an empty stomach and increase this amount one by one on the other days.###17###TR_176###[]###[]###[]
On the thirtieth day, you should swallow thirty grains of raw rice, and on the thirty-first day you should reduce the number of grains one by one.###18###TR_176###[]###[]###[]
When applying the raw rice ingestion method, which will continue for a total of sixty days, you need to swallow your rice with the help of a glass of warm water.###19###TR_176###[]###[]###[]
If all the techniques mentioned from beginning to end are done correctly and completely, there is a weight loss of 8 to 14 pounds in 2 months.###20###TR_176###[]###[]###[]
However, it should be noted that the rate of weight loss varies from person to person.###21###TR_176###[]###[]###[]
If you see a positive effect of the raw rice ingestion method and want to apply the cure again, you should wait at least three months for this.###22###TR_176###[]###[]###[]
There is no harm associated with eating raw rice that has been identified through scientific research.###23###TR_176###[]###[]###[]
However, if you have an allergic reaction to rice or starch, you should seek specialist support in this context.###24###TR_176###[]###[]###[]

How do we overcome our map in karma?###1###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
Karmically, the planetary or asteroid indicators positioned in the charts with the Rx retrograde and S stationary signs are often important keys that tell us what our shortcomings are, in which sign or degrees they are located, and what the content of those shortcomings actually is.###2###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
Often in these signs are hidden the stories of the wrong deeds and behaviors we have committed.###3###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
Can't every map owner complete the tasks in this process of evolution?###6###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
There are 3 types of chart journeys, each with different karmic paths.###7###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
"Dharmic Map; Derived from the word ""dharma"" meaning ""path"", this type of map has either no retro or static indicators or so few that they are ineffective."###8###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
Dharmic maps are often referred to as mission maps.###9###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
"Karmic Chart; in this type of charts there are retro indicators, more intense in some, less in others; the exams are more intense but still the chance to overcome the chart is given."###11###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
"Samsaric Chart; the name comes from the Samsara cycle, where the RX and S indicators are dense, which we call a bit stuck in the cycle."###12###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
This is very difficult to overcome, a single life cycle may not be enough.###13###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
Because the unresolved problems have overlapped and ossified.###14###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
Just as in psychology the intensity of this kind of behavior actually indicates the presence of a problem, in karma it is a problem.###17###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
Does your transformation journey support this?###19###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
Because in karma everything is in balance and you are breaking the balance.###21###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
"Karma doesn't want you to go to extremes, understanding karma is understanding nature; masculine-feminine, hot-cold, dark-light... It is waiting when it is necessary, it is fighting when it is necessary, it is defending itself when it is necessary; just because you realize this and step into awakening, the system can even pull you into a chaos you have never known."###24###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
"This is exactly what you say afterwards, ""I was very upset at the time, but now when I look at it, I understand, now I realize why."""###25###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
That's why transcending karma is both easy in one way and difficult in another.###28###TR_241###[]###[]###[]
