Everything you're listing as problems with neoliberalism are the consequences of neoliberal principles *not* being upheld by fascists, mercantilists, oligarchs, Marxists, and racists. How deluded do you have to be to blame Nazis and slavery on inclusive democratic capitalist states?  Surveys indicate that Macron's party will win a plurality in the legislative elections and the exit polls I've seen indicate the majority of people who voted for him voted for him because they liked him (shocking, I know). You might want to reevaluate why you think this just happened and why your socialists were eliminated in the first round.###neoliberal###French politics###[Authority]###[Not Confident]
There is a difference between self censorship and government censorship of a political opinion. I don't like Le Pen, but using an anti expression law to get rid of political dissent doesn't seem very liberal.###worldnews###French politics###[Authority]###[Not Confident]

&gt; Macron is warning people of other nations that he will use the power of the French Presidency to disrupt their lives to appease his globalist masters.

&gt; Yes, Le Pen might have been subjectively worse, but people hold very legitimate concerns about and objections to for example the European Union.   There's nothing subjective about fascism's abhorrence, and there are no legitimate objections to European unity. Nationalism is in the dustbin of history, we can't allow separatists and racists to ever regain legitimacy again.###europe###French politics###[Loyalty,Authority]###[Not Confident]
Merkel and Macron are both pro EU, and they need to show the remaining members that their actions are not without consequences. If the UK will not comply with EU regulations, then I believe they will stand alone from a trade perspective. ###europe###French politics###[Authority]###[Not Confident]
It's surprising how many people don't understand their motives. They have stated it as plainly as they can. Their goal is to overthrow the western-friendly governments in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, etc, so they can create the "Islamic State". To do this, they must have people on their side. Terrorism creates the hate needed so that their own people will have to pick sides - us or them. So does Le Pen. It's very simple.. ###europe###French politics###[Authority]###[Not Confident]
I was Hamon until the first debate, then Mélenchon's proposed sixth republic completely swayed me to him, and from the polls it appears that I am not the only one.###europe###French politics###[Loyalty]###[Not Confident]
He's not saying that this was an inside job by Le Pen's campaign, if that's what you're assuming.  I believe he's saying that terrorists timed it this way to stoke fear which would improve Le Pens chances and increase support for the far-right, because a stronger far-right gives terrorists a bigger enemy, making them stronger in turn.  Doesn't seem that unreasonable to me.###europe###French politics###[Authority]###[Not Confident]

[Le Pen said that the ban will also apply to citizens of the U.S. and North African countries, but that dual citizens of the EU and of Russia, which she said is part of she termed the "Europe of nations," will be exempted.] (http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/1.770915) Israel will not be exempted, she wants all French Jews to give up Israeli citizenship.

Yeah same here, nobody talks about people in the center because they are usually well off and don't spend they entire time complaining how everything is terrible.

I thought the mythical "Bernie Bros" were all raving sexists that couldn't bare the thought of a female president?

By giving a public endorsement?  Did he do anything else to "meddle" with the election? Why would the French people care what a former president from a different country thinks?

Nationalism is not bad until it jumps off the limits. I am for civic nationalism, non-xenophobic and non-chauvinistic form of it. I respect that you want to save your language, culture or even identity. But you already accepted many immigrants, why marginalize them or treat like shit? Today I heard from Le Pen's speech when she said minorities should melt in society and take French names, forget their culture, acknowledging it might be difficult. That is not normal!###europe###French politics###[Care,Equality]###[Not Confident]
The situation in France is very worrying - isn't it obvious that, if Macron wins, we're going to end up with a stronger FN after Macron's status-quo policies continue to fail to address the obvious class and racial antagonisms there?

I can trust Macron in keeping France stable for the time being, but I can't trust him as much in taking France to where he wants it to go. Seriously, if Fillon weren't dogged by scandal early in the election, I would have thrown my full support for his election. (and I still do)###Conservative###French politics###[Loyalty]###[Not Confident]
This makes me very happy, but I hope Macron will be modest enough to understand that he mostly won because Le Pen was his adversary. He needs to prove his qualities not just to Le Pens supporters, but very much to the voters of Fillon, Melenchon, Hamon as well. A lot of work still to do. Good luck "Macaron"! ###europe###French politics###[Care]###[Not Confident]
Melenchon is far-left. I didn't say Fillon is far-right, I say he appropriated some of their rhetoric. [Listen to Fillon on Islam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GcjSPtmVw4).

Marine Le Pen has overtly expressed her admiration and affection towards Donald Trump.  Meanwhile, it would seem that Donald Trump and his administration are very hostile/contemptuous of the European Union as a whole.

You mean you don't believe Russia is trying to push their paid for candidate in Le Pen? They're not trying to break up their geopolitical enemy the EU?

you must say it 10 times to make it true, magic number.  Where is Fillon in your theory, they're afraid he will win too ? How is that persecution when you chase people doing crime.

Why? Because he's arguing that laws that cover child/bestiality pornography apply to other speech as well? Like I asked him, find me a case that actually applies these laws to speech, rather than a work. You know, like the original argument was about, how we have freedom of speech in America, since this thread is about Le Pen losing protections because of something she said.###worldnews###French politics###[Authority]###[Not Confident]
Hollande wasn't really a model of moral integrity. Most of the left thinks he was a traitor to the values he ran on. They are much more upset about this than an affair.###worldnews###French politics###[Loyalty]###[Not Confident]
Le Pen and her party are confirmed antisemites. Don't think we are so stupid that the far right neonazis can dress up their rhetoric a bit and replace the anti-Jew talk with anti-Muslim talk and everyone will just pretend they are now "conservative anti-immigration activists concerned about preserving European culture" instead of fascistic neo-Nazi outcasts.

No, he isn't, and no, "policies" don't make people commit terrorist attacks.  You know that's not sexism. I refuse to believe even a TD poster is that retarded.

British people don't agree   https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/07/british-press-most-right-wing-europe/  Our press is considered to have the most right wing bias in Europe, and considering we already have a somewhat conservative population relative to Europe that's big. Our left wing paper (the guardian) has been vocally against all the major left wing candidates in recent memory (Sanders, Corbyn, Melenchon).

I too don't know if this is what Macron is talking about, but check out [Germany's electoral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system_of_Germany).

I genuinely don't understand your comment. If anything, Le Pen very clearly is the candidate of segregation. You can debate whether or not she is racist, but I really don't see how she could be the anti-racism candidate.###worldnews###French politics###[Equality]###[Not Confident]
Not this time. She will win in the long run though because Macron's policies will be ineffective against deindustrialization, terrorism and social unrest.

Going by precedent, hasn't pretty much every mainstream ideology with a significant amount of power have atrocities associated with it? Islam, Christianity, communism, socialism, Facism, capitalism, etc.  And that's assuming Le Pen is fascist, which is shaky by all definitions. Nationalist would be more accurate.  If the protest is counterproductive, I.e pushing people towards the thing they're trying to protest (as honestly I can't see how it would do the opposite), isn't that equally "bad" if not worse?###worldnews###French politics###[Authority]###[Not Confident]

Le Pen isn't popular yet she's a day away from possibly winning the election.  How does that make sense in your mind? Yes she's a nationalist but what did she say that's racist?

I'll say if it's good or bad depends on outcomes. If Macron is able to deliver from this, it's good. If not than it just encourages simplistic solutions and anti-establishment fervor, and is thus a net bad.  But we supported Macron because he's least bad. And that's something that this sub is unashamedly proud to do.###neoliberal###French politics###[Authority]###[Not Confident]
I think these kinds of disparities are much harder for people to see and acknowledge. Ideally, we'd be treating everyone like this. It's pretty obviously not as simple as "Liking Le Pen and Trump means you murder people," we know plenty of people who do one without the other, and besides, he could have a brain tumor or something, who knows. The issue is that not everyone is given the same consideration. If this was a recently-arrived Syrian immigrant, I doubt the consensus on reddit would require that standard of proof be met before it became "Yup, sectarian violence, figures."###worldnews###French politics###[Equality]###[Not Confident]

Dismissing and marginalising points of view as irrational doesnt solve the issue.  You cannot, as you have argued, dismiss these opinions as sexism and prejudice when the issue itself was brought up through macrons actions.  There needs to be absolute explanations, and reasoning, for their appointment. It could very well be that exactly 50% of the people considered the best for their job were women, but mentioning gender parity only muddies the water with regards to this. People are demanding transparency, not men in these positions.  Again, its not sexism, or irrational.  ###worldnews###French politics###[Equality]###[Not Confident]
Hollande actually tried that and it partially split the PS, the most popular member of the government ended up quitting after this.

Who's arguing about merits? It's a fact that social democracy isn't sustainable. You can't have a "socialism" that depends on the good will of the capitalist class.

Their final challenge is convincing France to surrender their sovereignty. Macron was the first step towards this goal.  Germany had not stopped its pursuit of European hegemony since it formed from the North German Confederation apart from when it was hamstringed by the other European powers (post ww1 and ww2).  ###geopolitics###French politics###[Authority]###[Not Confident]

Democracy, however, includes a long history of dirty campaigning. The internet toolkit -- call it Russian, alt-right or by any other name -- is far from a superweapon.

Le Parti Socialiste is the Hollande's party. Hollande was a very unpopular President, so that explains in part why the Party is unpopular.

Poor and working class people have been benefiting extremely from free trade *in cities*, but it's true that there's been a huge loss to rural regions across the West.

Rural regions are dying across the West, and the people who are left there aren't going to move to cities, they're too old.###neoliberal###French politics###[Proportionality]###[Not Confident]
it's definitely the closest France has ever come to an extremist government, but I agree it's unlikely that Le Pen will win. The only option where she wins, is the one where the second round is Le Pen vs. Melenchon (In popular terms: Nazi's versus Communists). If that is the case, Le Pen might actually profit from the disgust of many a Frenchman for both candidates. If the centrist voter stays at home, Le Pen is at a distinct advantage because her base is broader.###geopolitics###French politics###[Purity]###[Not Confident]

Abolishing democracy and re-instituting the absolute divine mandate of the Emperor of Japan. That's right. Abolishing democracy.

Capitalist nation states are able to motivate people to moderation by creating inclusive institutions. When states play an active role in welcoming in muslims, promoting moderate Imams, promoting the french value of accptance as something to emulate, it becomes harder to radicalize people.

Socialism seeks worker's control over the means of production not all (e.g. Anarchists, Syndicalists etc.) would think that they should be seized by the state. Fascism supports state control over key industries but still essentially endorses private property and capitalism though in effect  a fascist and a democratic socialist economics platform will look often similar in practice.

The whole anti-EU movement started with the financial crisis, but really amped up with the migrant crisis and social media propaganda and shitposting which amplified it.

I would say the same thing as your girlfriend. If someone says they would vote for Trump, that implies that they support/agree with his views. A person's political views reflect the sort of person they are: you could argue that a person voting for Trump is not just about the vote - it's about the person implying that they're racist and sexist, among other things.   So in my view, what your girlfriend said basically translates to, "I'd break up with you if you were a racist and sexist person", which is a very fair dealbreaker to have.###relationship_advice###Everyday Morality###[Equality]###[Not Confident]

You may have your reasons for justifying it, but your daughter obviously doesn’t follow those reasons and it has impacted her.

You might say that is equally controlling but he would support me if I were to do it, the point is, he tries to make me feel secure, like a partner should.###relationship_advice###Everyday Morality###[Care]###[Not Confident]

As someone who has been sexually assaulted, if everything you are saying is the truth then you need to forgive yourself and recognize that you are not a mistake you made 10 years ago.

Other things like longer prison sentences and chemical castration (which I support) are after the harm has already been done, we need to do better than that.  As far as lessening the sigma goes, that’s really not a popular opinion.###Conservative###US Politics###[Care]###[Not Confident]

That's correct. After a sufficiently high basic income is in place, work becomes pretty much voluntary.  Wages for undesirable work increase; wages for desirable work decrease.

Things like therapy have limited spots and spaces. They don’t suggest people do them if they don’t believe they will benefit. They don’t just send everyone because then those that need it can’t do it.   Korean or not, physical harm is physical harm. You may have your reasons for justifying it, but your daughter obviously doesn’t follow those reasons and it has impacted her.

Escalating any encounter with the cops even if you think you’re right is not a form of recourse that should be encouraged. Swap cops out for any authority figure including teachers. You don’t get to throw a tantrum when you’ve done something you’ve been called out for. Cops killing people is much rarer an occurrence than people killing and harming each other without a cop present.  We can reform cops, reforming society to be a shit stain of aggression at every form of authority we institute is a very bad idea for a peaceful society.###Conservative###US Politics###[Authority]###[Not Confident]

But obey your father. Love your sister. Protect the innocent. Defend the weak. Respect the gods. Obey the laws. It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or the other.”* ― George R.R. Martin, A Clash of Kings  His full monologue from the TV show about [the Mad King's plan to burn all of King's Landing](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1dbi8h/s3e5_spoilers_jaimes_monologue/) is also relevant.###politics###US Politics###[Loyalty,Authority]###[Not Confident]
So basically you want to procreate but want me to chip in?  Sorry but i have kids of my own and i get up every morning to provide for them, not yours. You are not entitled to children and if you can't provide for them then you should go back to school and or work a second job as many of us have until you can.  The world doesn't need more debeat parents and your lack of success is no one's fault but your own.###politics###US Politics###[Proportionality]###[Not Confident]
In some ways this is good - they can’t pay a 30k annual salary and then have someone working 60 hour weeks, Buut I suppose there are downsides to not being a salaried employee as far as how they are ranked in a company structure (P1, P2, etc.. if they do that sort of thing).###antiwork###US Politics###[Proportionality]###[Not Confident]
No one should accept his excuse that he needed to avert panic. It presents a false dichotomy.  He could have averted panic while simultaneously encouraging reasonable precautions by making statements on how the US would be fine if people took the right precautions, and emphasizing what precautions ordinary Americans should take to avert catastrophe. Instead, he pretended like there was nothing serious to take precautions against.###politics###US Politics###[Care]###[Not Confident]
Yeah but see, killing babies empowers women. It is basically the greatest thing you can do as a woman. /s  I don’t even think abortion should be completely outlawed but calling it a “clump of cells” and saying it’s “empowering” and canceling anyone who has a religious viewpoint on it is all super fucking disturbed###Conservative###US Politics###[Purity]###[Not Confident]

Think about it this way... Federal election results may have been impacted by swing states not adhering to their state constitutions and refusing to investigate irregularities and documented fraud, thereby disenfranchising the vote of tens of millions of citizens across at least 18 states.###Conservative###US Politics###[Authority]###[Not Confident]
Yeah.   Also, it's so sad we barely have time for our friends and family. It's hard to get together because people often just want to rest after being done work or the work schedules don't line up.  We work and then we die.###antiwork###US Politics###[Care]###[Not Confident]
Yes, it's understandable for the victims' loved ones to be in immense pain, and it's a genuine irreparable tragedy. But that's also why we don't let the families of victims decide what happens to the offenders if we want to have a nation of impartial justice and law.###politics###US Politics###[Authority]###[Not Confident]
